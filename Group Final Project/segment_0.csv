1. due to a low player count, there were instances of imbalanced lobbies with level 100 players facing off against level 10 players. to address this, they increased the hitbox/rate for lowlevel players and decreased it for highlevel players. despite widespread complaints, no actions have been taken. (i played it on a lowlevel account, and the hit rate is insane....)
2. after a few months since the game's launch, the ingame currency system is already broken. most levelup rewards consist of ""cookies"", which are almost useless because the best skins require real money. a reward cap was implemented a few weeks ago, limiting players to receive max 2 rewards per day. despite daily forum posts (23 every day), they only recently increased the cap to 3 rewards. however, the majority of rewards are still cookies, and the overall quantity has decreased. this means that players have to invest more time but receive fewer rewards.
3. the patch notes doesn't include everything that was changed into the game.

 there's no battle pass???
i mean, i don't understand if we're expected to all play with the same super extensive list of character selection? i mean, there's really nothing bringing me back week after week to spend my money on so i'm kinda lost? do you just get all of it for free?

 mmr is too chaotic
the fluctuation between a game that plays like a sunday drive then an mlg tournament the next gives me an emotional high i haven't experienced since grade school. i think a more defined leveling system will help balance out the playing field, also bots are cracked, valve plz fix. also, no prestige option???

 my face hurts everytime i play.
i literally have too much fun that my cheeks are absolutely killing me by the end of the game, my face hurts too.

 there's a lot of achievements
i really can't ever choose which ones to focus on or what i should be paying attention to first, i just get really cool stuff all the time. i think this part of the game could be replaced with the battle pass.

that being said, very good game, excited to see if more animal options will be released!

devs kept putting out patches making constant changes to hitreg and how maps work. it isn't consistent and changes constantly which is annoying and doesn't always work properly.

also, once you reach pass level 100, you can no longer earn nemo bucks. they recently only started to offer 2 boxes of cookies a day and you can't earn any higher than that. i'm not sure if my game has glitched but for the past two days, i can't even collect my two box prizes of cookies. i've written in a help ticket but this limitation is irritating especially when level 100 players want to purchase new skins.

this game had potential but the devs seem confused and don't know how to handle this game properly. for a while they implemented random 4x4 plays but people complained and they were removed. why not just give us an option for that feature instead of forcing it upon players randomly?

these inconsistent and dumb decisions are destroying the game. they have less people playing now than among us. among us has been out for years! so that's very telling.

party animals might of been a blast if the day i came home to play party animals my effing friend wasn't already home playing party animals on my pc. i told him to get off my pc so i can play party animals and he was all like no i got on first. after 3hrs of playing with his fat fingers i get to play because his mom told him to get home for sup. side note she makes a great mac and cheese. anyway i finally get to play party animals but my dang key bored was all sticky from my friend and his fat fingers because he loves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

the game was made in unity. the graphic is good. the game still fun even with this bad hit reg issue also if you thinking about being competitive in this game. you probably wrong, rng always beat skills.

multiple game mode
atleast not every game mode have a goal to abuse all these animals (ko).
would say few 4v4 team mode got something unique.

animals selection variety
there are multiple animal you can select even from starter. once you progress a while you get more animals in your animal selection screen.

not made for competitive (bad precision)
due to honky wonky janky hit detection, some of your hit won't register the worst case if you were too laggy. the game is very inconsistent with the hit reg and knock out timing.

assist: janky crosshair.
you can assist your teammate after you were fully knocked out. the jank at your crosshair not always aiming at correctly. sometimes it went far off from your crosshair also even if you successfully/accidently hit someone it just either knocked out or not.

skins
you can get skin for free or paid (microtransaction). i wouldn't recommend you spend $ on nemo buck if you don't give any funk about skins. the price is not worth and worst case that 
 legendary skin almost double the base game price.

mtx (microtransaction)
only skins as for now. you can still play all game mode with no extra cost. the skin price is kinda bad especially the nemo bucks. nemo buck can acquire from achievement and leveling progress. all of these are one time reward once you reach lv.100 you can't earn more unless buying with the garbage pricing.

gacha / lootbox
ony for skins.  skin for legendary tier, epic tier can get through here at rate 1.6%ish. the egg coins (assuming the currency for gacha) use to get randomized skin. there is pity system for this where in every 70spin if you haven't got any legendary you are guarantee to get 1. while epic tier will always guarantee at every 10spins. oh yeah you can use nemo bucks for that too.

152156400,english,"pretty fun little online brawler. especially fun when queuing up with a friend or playing locally. main problems as of writing the review: afk players and skill disparity in the community. afaik the developers are trying to update the game to make matchmaking more fair, but chances are if you are a casual player and aren't really into the competitive aspect of the game (especially if solo queuing) you won't have a good time. toxicity levels are manageable, some players will focus you (again, a much bigger problem when playing solo) but voice chat is mostly harmless in my experience. 

regarding microtransactions and skins: if you are putting hours into the game  you won't have to pay a dime for pretty much anything you want. i currently only know about 1 skin pack outright locked behind a paywall. level rewards are generous and skins that cost normal currency are basically free, especially once you hit level 100. paid currency drops in decent amounts from level ups, i never had to buy a skin for money and even managed to gift a fairly expensive skin. the issue may become worse (or better, actually) as more content is introduced and additional levels are added (though i'm not aware of developer plans to add more levels atm) 

all in all, if you like competitive online games that are a bit more random party animals comes recommended. queue times are not long right now and the game is not annoyingly random (though this also kinda depends on the map). skillful players will outmatch luck 90% of the time, i'd say. bugs are basically non existent, which is also a big plus. what little bugs i've encountered have been more fun than annoying.",1701046198,1701046198,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,True,,,,76561198036711061,544,7,6648,156,3951,1706556958,"['online brawler', 'main problems', 'skill disparity', 'casual player', 'competitive aspect', 'good time', 'bigger problem', 'much anything', 'skin pack', 'cost normal', 'normal currency', 'paid currency', 'decent amounts', 'expensive skin', 'additional levels', 'more levels', 'competitive online', 'random party', 'skillful players', 'non existent', 'big plus', 'bugs i', 'more fun']",0,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.7269}",0.7269,0.07912311265969801,0.09523809523809523

this game is not competitive like csgo why is this even here lemme just play and this will also still happen if your teamate leaves or is a bot nor you cant leave in the map vote or character selection screen either and i see what the creators are trying to do but its all in like a 30 minute ban or none. not a 2 minute thats right in the middle which does nothing. if you need to leave a game but dont want quick match ban just disconnect your internet wait for the game to kick you out then reconnect and no ban most of the time and when it does happen it shows that disconnect because of internet issues causing a quick match ban
voting system
lemme just plays the gamemodes i want instead of a voting system wheres its the same few maps over and over
broken gamemodes conveyor takes way to long per round i could leave at the start and by the time the quick match ban is over that round would be in the last 30 seconds
trebuchet enemies take way to long to knockout just for them to wake up in one second instead of a river between i would reccomend a pit so there is not getting back out of the river
winters coming same as conveyor takes too long
rng and weekly shop system
if you like a skin well too bad it either has to show up in shop which only repeats every 3 weeks or get it from the gacha rng system which is mostly repeats too
custom exclusive maps
i have no friends that play this game and i bet most people dont or atleast not enough to comprise of a full match in the better gamemodes such as the bar fight and subway
totorial barly teaches anything thing
it does not teach you many feature that can be very helpful
lag issue
could just be me but for some reason every round there atleast a ping spike where my ping goes to 2 thousand and makes the game unplayable for 5 to 10 seconds which is enough time to determine who win and who loses
this game should not be worth 20 dollars for a broken and still heavily unfinished game
dont think i need to explain this just get it when its on a discount
devs lying about what would be in the game upon release
still dont think i need to explain this
every update is 6 months apart from each other and if its quicker than that its usually a new skin\
just dont get this game heres another thing i never actually enounter hackers but i bet if you were to hack the game the devs would take 6 months to patch that
side note ( if you win too much or are to good at the game you will more likely be getting players that are afk or ai. and also just recently i got a quick match ban for no reason i did not even leave in the middle of a match not even at all maybe it was bc of spam reports or suspected hacking but it feels like if you win too much the game will screw you over)",1700678461,1706386707,False,0,1,0.0,0,True,False,False,True,,,,76561198379130804,0,2,5592,1268,4736,1707086180,"['minute quick', 'quick match', 'map vote', 'quick match', 'ban most', 'quick match', 'few maps', 'broken gamemodes', 'quick match', 'seconds trebuchet', 'trebuchet enemies', 'long rng', 'weekly shop', 'exclusive maps', 'i bet', 'bet most', 'most people', 'full match', 'better gamemodes', 'gamemodes such', 'helpful lag', 'game unplayable', 'enough time', 'unfinished game', 'new skin\\', 'enounter hackers', 'i bet', 'quick match', 'spam reports']",0,"{'neg': 0.135, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': -0.4588}",-0.4588,0.025996009199134196,0.13181818181818183

personal view:
1º 
i didn't like much the shop, and i still don't like it. i accept the developers need money to keep the updates and servers, but the price of the nemo bucks are too high sadly.
they don't update much the shop, is always the same skins in a loop.

2º
when you reach lvl 100 you will only get cookies (the ""not valuable"" coin of the game), but at that point you can already have all the cookie purchable skins on the shop and the locker, which make them useless. 
because you don't get any reward when you already have all archivements and all possible skins (without paying more money), it make the game more boring, knowing that no matter if you win or lose, you will not get anything.
the only moment i had to use my cookies where during hallowen event (2 skins on the shop with a price of 18.000 and 25.000 cookies aprox) and the lunar festival (1 skin of 25.000 aprox)
i ocasionally play because i like the game but the lack of new rewards, at least egg coins or nemo bucks, make the game not so exciting. it is good for an hour of fun with friends tho. 
at the moment of this review i have 986k cookies, i hope one day i can do something with them.

3º
the gacha machine, is the worst friendly gacha i ever seen. to use it you need egg coins (a special coin that you only get on events or lvl up between 1100) or you can use nemo bucks (1200 nemo bucks = 13€ more or less)
you, ofc, will get a lot of common and uncommon rewards instead of epic and legendary, that's normal.
the thing of getting only cookies when you get repeated skins is just  , you get a useless coin compensation for wasting a ""valuable coin"" that can cost money. that will make everyone not want to play the horrible gacha machine with money ever. bad strategy. at least give something like a ""coin fragment"" so people can try again every x tries on the machine.

i feel compelled to share my thoughts on party animals because, despite the mixed feedback it has received, i genuinely believe it's a pretty good game. it's important to note that many of the negative reviews may be related to misconceptions about local play, as the game actually requires an online connection. however, this shouldn't overshadow the fact that party animals offers a decent gaming experience.

the game's core loop revolves around a series of minigames and fight rounds in a team format, with team sizes varying between two and four players based on the random matchmaking system. the standout feature is its ragdoll combat mechanics, which some might dismiss as purely luckbased. however, with practice, it becomes apparent that the game can be highly competitive when facing skilled opponents. while luck does play a minor role, mastering skills like quick weapon pickups, accurate drop kicks, and strategic player tossing depends more on player skill and feedback.

admittedly, the game's progression can feel repetitive over extended play sessions, making it better suited for shorter, more casual gaming sessions. the inclusion of a free battle pass system is a nice touch, and despite the presence of microtransactions, i never felt pressured to make any purchases. most of the items available for purchase are cosmetic, and the game generously provides free players with plenty of skins and items.

like any online multiplayer game, the party animals community can be a mixed bag, with elements of toxicity and competitiveness, but it also has its share of friendly and helpful players. ultimately, i'd recommend party animals to anyone looking for a simple, laidback game where you can goof around without taking things too seriously.

in conclusion, party animals offers a fun and enjoyable gaming experience, especially for those seeking a relaxed multiplayer environment with moments of hilarity and skill. give it a try, and you might be pleasantly surprised by what it has to offer.",1699288440,1699288512,True,0,0,0.0,0,True,False,False,True,,,,76561198072847564,131,1,13628,517,6259,1707110083,"['mixed feedback', 'good game', 'negative reviews', 'local play', 'online connection', 'decent gaming', 'fight rounds', 'minor role', 'quick weapon', 'accurate drop', 'strategic player', 'extended play', 'casual gaming', 'free battle', 'nice touch', 'items available', 'free players', 'online multiplayer', 'mixed bag', 'helpful players', 'laidback game', 'enjoyable gaming', 'relaxed multiplayer']",0,"{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.532, 'pos': 0.372, 'compound': 0.9451}",0.9451,0.09216229348882407,0.1323529411764706

original review included below:

there are a myriad of issues plaguing the game which personally makes it hard to recommend buying it in its current state. i really do enjoy playing, but game bugs are frustrating and spoil the experience. however, i'm glad there is transparency about issue reporting on the [url=https://forum.partyanimals.com/t/bug] official game forums. [/url]

party animals is a fun teambased minigame extravaganza. together with a team of 24, you hop into various minigames with silly and wonky physics to win new costumes, animals and other customization options. across three game modes, you compete against each other on various different maps with fun little gimmicks.
if you've played cs(:s) minigames and mario party before, this game is definitely something fun for you!

although the issues below can be seen as minor, the ones that i've experienced at least a multitude of times are:

[list]
    []physics engine object issues such as the [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/iceberg.mp4] iceberg bits in ice breaker [/url] and [strike] [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/bomba_bridge.mp4] beatup bridge [/url] [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/another_bomba_bridge.mp4] spazzing out [/url] [/strike] resolved)
    []hands / paws targeting issues such as grabbing onto players in range and  [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/grabbing_issues_2.mp4] climbing [/url]  [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/grabbing_issues.mp4] structures [/url]
    []audio/visual issues such as camera in terrain clipping, [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/camerabug.mp4] random camera snapping [/url], game audio dropouts, erroneous sound effects, layer synchronization and mixing
    []game rewards issues such as problems gifting friends items, and tracking, redeeming offplatform game rewards
[/list]

for the average player these issues probably aren't problematic, especially if you're just looking to have fun with friends. if you're looking to unlock as many animals and customization options as possible though, issues like these can be seen as frustrating as they can hinder your efforts.
i hope that game issues will be resolved over time. i will change my review accordingly when improvements are made!",1698762183,1702740938,False,2,0,0.5199999809265136,1,True,False,False,True,,,,76561198058717653,311,27,7704,424,4646,1707092956,"['original review', 'current state', '[ url=https', 'official game', 'various minigames', 'wonky physics', 'new costumes', 'other customization', 'different maps', 'little gimmicks', '[ list', 'issues such', '[ url=https', '//storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/another_bomba_bridge.mp4 ]', 'issues such', '[ url=https', '//storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/grabbing_issues_2.mp4 ]', '//storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/grabbing_issues.mp4 ]', 'audio/visual issues', 'issues such', '[ url=https', '] random', 'erroneous sound', 'layer synchronization', 'issues such', 'offplatform game', '/list ]', 'average player', 'many animals']",0,"{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.953, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4215}",-0.4215,-0.03928467365967366,-0.06058612440191386

the people are rude and toxic in game and the game modes are basic and boring. the achievements in the game are either basic and easy or stupidly hard for a tiny reward; other achievements would take ages of boring game play with no way to do it faster, just takes ages and that's it. the achievements in this game suck.
 the characters them self are mediocre and they don't have many skins and the only skins you can get are lame and the good ones are very rare and sometimes lame ones are also rare,so if you got a rare one, you could just get a lame one instead.
 every update is another way for the developers to make the game a little bit worse in the name of ""balance"" but just end up making the game less fun and ruining the whole point. like when they decided to get rid of the fish over and over again, then completely swap it for something else. the whole point of the fish was to give the dead players a way to still do stuff, but they keep trying to take that way from people. they also like a lot of rng. each time you punch someone it does random damage.",1698404883,1705789742,False,1,0,0.5034558176994323,0,True,False,False,True,,,,76561199003527991,0,7,8137,0,8137,1705789079,"['horrible updates', 'good game', 'stupid choices', 'tiny reward', 'other achievements', 'boring game', 'many skins', 'good ones', 'lame ones', 'little bit', 'whole point', 'whole point', 'dead players', 'random damage']",0,"{'neg': 0.315, 'neu': 0.542, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': -0.7906}",-0.7906,-0.17868189102564105,-0.17578125

148833090,english,"party animals is a fun game with creative levels and cute characters you can earn through leveling, including additional costumes that can be earned through achievements or the shop as well. so in that sense, there is a lot of variety in which a player can choose and earn through progression. 

however there is a lot of unexplained bs i find myself experiencing the longer this game exists and i play it. i'm discovering i mostly experience this on a handful of last stand maps which include ichiban, winter is coming, wind tunnel, and gator valley. ichiban seems to suffer from irregular and varied windows in which the player will be instantly knocked out from a punch or item used by another player. not to mention it feels i have significantly less time to jump back up out of the gas than others players do, even dying within a second after losing consciousness regardless if i did before i was thrown down there. winter is coming is one of the most bs levels i've played given it seems i freeze a lot quicker than others players do at the end game while they can get up instantly or roll back without ever freezing at the end way too often to not be noticed. i see this happen on variety of other levels as well mentioned above at times including a handful of team levels. i don't know if that's due to anything in particular but it's becoming more apparent the longer i own this game. 

because of that alone, i find myself playing this game less and less due to the bs luck people get in general. as mentioned, they are able to wake from knockouts, get back onto ledges, or even roll back into play before timeouts on various levels way quicker than i can. i don't want to hear the ""lack of skill"" and that kinda crap. i've played this game during beta over 20 hours including the version from a couple years ago. it wasn't this bad at the start but you notice it more obviously the longer you play, whether a session or playing the game for a number of weeks. i'm seeing a game become less fair in non team games the longer i play this game. sadly that means it's becoming a crappier product unless it's 4v4 a lot of the time to balance out the unexplained bs.

would i recommend the games? yes. however i can't say i tend to have much fun outside of 4v4s with a friend as randoms are insufferable to deal with as your team mates in a 2v2 setting or the fact they expect you to fully carry them.",1698214000,1698214186,True,19,1,0.6257029175758361,2,True,False,False,True,,,,76561198149824899,350,23,5611,1120,2387,1706921142,"['fun game', 'creative levels', 'additional costumes', 'unexplained bs', 'i play', 'last stand', 'varied windows', 'less time', 'bs levels', 'lot quicker', 'other levels', 'game less', 'bs luck', 'various levels', 'non team', 'crappier product', 'unexplained bs', 'much fun']",0,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.923, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.4404}",0.4404,-0.006611111111111111,-0.02152777777777778

i really admire this game in most of the aspects. you don't often get a game that is this replayable, this carefully designed and this wellexecuted. as a party game it has the right vibe  the competitive aspect works just fine, not too much nor too light. on the other hand, the physics in the game hits different  it may look just like some other games which i won't name, but you have to play it to know how different they are. not to mention the cute visuals  probably is what attracts people in the first place! 

while the game is casual, the achievements are quite challenging. as much as i struggled with some of them, i have to say they are well designed. they provide a sufficient amount of challenges, and in the mean time fun to attempt and does not ruin the game for you teammates (for the most part, some of them does require you to be a little selfish).

there has been many controversies around the game. the price does prevent a significant amount of my friends from joining me. the devs may not have taken the right response in many occasions. however, rarely do i see a hateful comment on the game itself: almost everyone agrees this game is great to begin with. some may think overpriced, some may hate the microtransactions, but that does not hinder its outstanding gameplay!

147654054,english,"this game is getting a ton of hate over the gacha mechanics and because there are micro transactions. for one, you do not need to spend any real life money to acquire any skins in the game whatsoever. the ingame currency is attainable through just leveling up and playing the game. there has only been one skin that was locked behind a paywall, which was because it was a collaboration with some other company. i have played for 50 hours now, and have only spent 5 bucks for that one skin, but i have gathered dozens of other customization's through just playing the game. i find it ridiculous how people like to bash this game for it's micro transactions when nobody is forced to pay for it, if they had just played the game they would've had their desired skin in like an hour. also keep in mind this game is $30 dollars, there are companies that actually make you pay $70 dollars and still expect you to pay for a battle pass and other skins, while this game offers everything for free. 

a real critique that i can offer about the game is that it's maps sort of pale in comparison to gang beast's and that maps that are mainly fighting and throwing each other aren't the main focus, but rather more sort these little mini games and team competitions. another critique i'd give this game is that there isn't much else to do after hitting the max level, i personally haven't hit the max level as of yet, however i do hear about there being a lack of content after reaching level 100. the biggest thing that probably bothers me about this game is that there are some skins locked behind doing stuff on other apps, for example there was a tpain skin that you could only get from i believe tuning into the guy's stream. no offense but i aint tryna watch his ahh. there was also a tiktok skin, and other's, that seems like such a chore to do for a skin. 

what this game does well is just laughing at every game. in a typical game you can just expect to be beaten and tossed around, watch a bunny beat a gorilla to death in some corner, and a bear dropkicking some other animal. this game's funky physics, movement, and implementation of weapons and stage hazards, offer a good balance of competition and party craziness. also as i said, the fact that everything is attainable through just playing the game is a big plus, the closest thing i can compare it to is when you would buy a skin pack in pvz garden warfare 2 if that makes sense. 

the one thing that this game will always have my support over gang beasts is that it actually updates there game regularly with new cosmetics and even stages, unlike that dead game that hasn't been updated in over a year. but yeah, this game is fun, definitely needs work on there being grounded stages for just fighting and for there to be a bit more diversity other than just 2v2v2v2, but it's still young and has been making efforts to improve.",1696466694,1707113268,True,4,0,0.5315024256706237,0,True,False,False,True,,,,76561198983920010,0,18,3002,774,3002,1707019455,"['micro transactions', 'real life', 'ingame currency', 'other company', 'other customization', 'micro transactions', 'other skins', 'real critique', 'maps sort', 'main focus', 'more sort', 'little mini', 'max level', 'biggest thing', 'other apps', 'typical game', 'bunny beat', 'other animal', 'good balance', 'big plus', 'closest thing', 'skin pack', 'pvz garden', 'new cosmetics', 'dead game', 'bit more', 'more diversity', 'diversity other']",0,"{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': -0.34}",-0.34,-0.13816070541480382,0.039943181818181815

this game is [b] not pay to win [/b] the only microtransactions for the game are cosmetic wise and you can still get the currency from playing the game itself.

[h1] offline misinterpretation [/h1]

what the original description meant for this game is that you could play with your friends via coop mode on the same device/room. the game did not mean to say that you could play without any internet.

[h1] delay problems [/h1]

this game has been around since 2019 and has experienced some long delays in it's life. rest assured, [b] if a game is being delayed that means there it is being polished and worked on to become even greater [/b]

[h1] microtransactions [/h1]

as stated earlier, this game is not pay to win but it does have microtransactions. the only thing you can buy in the game are the currency which [b] can be earned via playing the game [/b]

146917035,english,"party animals is an addictingly fun arena brawler with incredibly cute and fuzzy animals, each level has its own unique gimmick and each round feel reasonably short & sweet. 

you can que with up to 3 friends for quickmatch where you can vote on 1 of 3 levels to play which can either be the last stand type levels, where all players are divided into teams of 2 for a first to 3 survival where you try to be the last man standing, hope is not lost if you're eliminated as you can throw in various objects into the field which can either save your duo partner from elimination or secure the round for someone else in a very comedic effect. alternatively you can also vote to play any of the 4v4 team maps where you need to work together as a team to score points and win.

if just playing random maps with other players isn't your forte, then you can always host your own customgames where you can play against bots and customize the game rules to your heart's content, if you only want to play privately with friends then this mode is for you. you even have access to play a pair of fight club levels where your teams objective is to pumble and yeet your opponents off the safe areas of maps until the other team runs out of lives.

as far as balance goes some items can feel incredible oppressive and difficult to work against, unless you can time your punches and jump kicks right you might end up having someone smack you with a shovel until you're knocked out for good or comically yeeted off the stage, while other items like the freeze and stunguns can feel incredibly oppressive to fight against at times, if nobody who's already eliminated knocks down the gun standing player that has someone in an indefinite stunlock, it can very easily feel like you're not allowed to play the game when someone is perfectly positioned to constantly hit you with the stungun with every shot...

[h2] but... [/h2] [h3] i can already hear the incoming critiques [/h3]

since this is recreate game's [b] first [/b] game we should cut them some slack. giving them feedback is way better than just attacking the developers. they are listening to suggestions and feedback on discord so you should be happy they are doing this unlike other companies who completely ignore the community. you can check their official pages for more info and get updates.

this game is [b] amazing! [/b] i've waited over [b] three years [/b] for it to come out and it's just fun as i remembered. although i think they could have released it back then and slowly added updates to it, i know there won't be the same amount of hype for it as before. hours will fly by and each game does not feel long at all! each game is different and you will always find some crazy way to win or lose. this is why i rate it a 8/10.

[b] now for the bad. [/b]

[h3] weapons: [/h3] something that i've noticed many people comment on, is the balancing of the weapons. 
some weapons are too strong or too random and this factor only frustrates players like myself. if they can make it a set amount of damage per weapon so it can be a skill issue then it will be a blessing, but i doubt this will happen anytime soon. any weapon should not be able to throw you so far! one hit with any weapon it could be a game over for that match.

[h3] grabbing: [/h3] this might sound stupid but why am i able to grab on to well, anything! i know this was intentional as i heard in the tutorial you can grab, pick up, and punch anything. but why! i find myself constantly grabbing on the floor, team members, and that [b] random brick [/b] on [b] ""ichiban"" [/b]. they should have a feature that only allows you to grab on to certain parts of the map never the floor, as well as not being able to grab and knock out your teammates even though in certain cases you need too for them to survive. i think the game will do just fine and it will get rid of those annoying cases where either you or your teammate ruin the match because one knocks the other out.

[h3] maps: [/h3] some maps need balancing and minor tweaks. for example, i can already tell ""beast hockey"" will have the lowest play count. it's not because it isn't fun but it's because the puck, and how heavy it is, makes it so unpredictable, anything can happen. you can't run around it on time. you can't stand in front of it or you get knocked and thrown with it. you can hardly move because it's ice...(why not on ice skates and make it faster/better control). you also can't aim properly because of the huge size. i've seen 4 players leave the map all at once and then our team got kicked because there were not enough players. i can hardly imagine how other matches are going. so balancing and minor changes to some maps will make them fun and people will want to play them.


[h3] conclusion: [/h3] there are more things people are rightfully complaining about but it's not a part of the core gameplay. offline, servers, loot eggs, demo rewards, item shop, all can be forgotten when you just want to play the game. well except for offline but you can't expect a 1v1 or a 2v6 (ai) match to be as much fun as the 2v6 (real players) which the maps were intended for. that was an error on their part and if you bought it for offline play then just get a refund. i promise you'll keep the game and it will be much more fun playing online.
 
well, let me know if you agree or disagree with what i mentioned and you better hope i don't come across you in a lobby. [b] ""waalltuhhhhh""convict sparky aka veteranclashgaming [/b]

our intention with th sentence ""paw it out with your friends both online and offline."" was to convey that you can play with your friends remotely (online), or together in the same location using the same device (offline) through split-screen.

we sincerely apologize for any confusion our wording caused. it was never our intention to mislead our player base about the availability of an offline mode.

the game did not feature an offline mode in the recent three rounds of playtesting either. intentionally misleading our players while conducting playtests that clearly reveal the absence of an offline mode would be nonsensical. (we admit, however, that our description could have been more thoughtfully worded...)

if you get banned, even temporarily, for whatever reason, you will not be able to access the game, not even to play with bots. 

that's what you get with an ""always online"" party game.




it's a fun game. it can be addictive at times, especially if you don't want to bother playing other games. 

however, the controls are not that good. the hits don't register properly, everyone is flopping around.

there is no way to recover after being knocked down, regardless of your stamina bar. you can mash all the buttons on your keyboard, but it really depends. it becomes frustrating to deal with these mechanics at some point.

some of the maps are also too small and badly designed (gator valley, typhoon). quick deaths are happening, without there being a very clear reason why, especially on maps with various elements (ichiban, ice breaker). two players fall down, at the same time, but somehow one freezes, or drowns or gets poisoned faster. last remaining players all die, but there is no draw, one player manages to win in some way.

the camera is not properly angled, and you cannot really change it.

the force quit punish is nonsensical.

two player splitscreen looks terrible.

the worst of it all, a gacha type system in a children's game, on top of all the microtransactions. it's awful.
