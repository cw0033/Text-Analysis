157602265,english,"Pros:
-Animals
-Party
-Funny mechanics
-A bunch of maps/gamemods

Cons:
-Gets repetitive after a short while, a ranked system would help on that
-It's manly a teamwork game and a game to play with friends, playing it solo becomes frustrating after a veeery short while (because you depend on your teammates and also it's not really that fun when you play alone)
-The mechanics are weird and the skill gap can be troublesome (some players are able to throw you half the map and you're barely moving them while they are stunned)

Overall: 7/10, I think it's an 8.5/10 if you have guys to play with and have fun and it would be 9/10 if a ranked system, a little more in depth tutorial, solo maps and more gamemods would be implemented",1707076676,1707076676,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198056822321,0,2,316,316,316,1707076353

157259563,english,"The game was awesome at the beginning, but they managed to ruin it:
1. Due to a low player count, there were instances of imbalanced lobbies with level 100 players facing off against level 10 players. To address this, they increased the hitbox/rate for low-level players and decreased it for high-level players. Despite widespread complaints, no actions have been taken. (I played it on a low-level account, and the hit rate is insane....)
2. After a few months since the game's launch, the in-game currency system is already broken. Most level-up rewards consist of ""cookies"", which are almost useless because the best skins require real money. A reward cap was implemented a few weeks ago, limiting players to receive max 2 rewards per day. Despite daily forum posts (2-3 every day), they only recently increased the cap to 3 rewards. However, the majority of rewards are still cookies, and the overall quantity has decreased. This means that players have to invest more time but receive fewer rewards.
3. The patch notes doesn't include everything that was changed into the game.

Like for example, the spectating system it has, where people who died/got eliminated can throw bananas, fishes, and even bombs at you as thier dead. It requires little to no skill to win the game since the spectating system can win or lose the game for you. Even if your the best player in the lobby and there's one person left and hes in the middle of drowning (as an example) you can still get hit by a fish and end up losing the game cause of it. There is multiple times where me and my team would've won the game but didn't due to the spectating system. But that is basically the only thing I don't like about this game, besides that. The only thing I would change is the nu chucks since its the most broken item in the game by far. Besides all that, its a fun game most of the time and is well made as well as having a wide range of customisation options that also has many different animals to play as.

The other is way more polished, has better support from devs and will last a lifetime with a healthy player base but suffers from being too competitive and toxic with a larger focus on team play than just going alone and enjoying a casual experience.

This game take the ragdoll death battle concept from Gang Beasts and Human Fall Flat, and inserts it into a fun title with beautiful graphics. This game, Party Animals, is about beating up your friends and foes and tossing about so your the last animal standing. 

I've dabbled in playing Gang Beasts before, but I will say that Party Animals really utilizes the ridiculously high quality graphics and the adorable cuteness of the characters to make it a genuinely hilarious experience whether playing with friends locally or online.

This game also has a bunch of different modes in which to engage in, each with in depth mechanics that make each one unique from the other. One stage has two trains running side by side, here you have to lug coal into your train while making sure the enemy team falls behind. Another stage is set in a winter cabin where you're supposed to toss your opponents outside so they freeze in the cold. There are a bunch of other stages that utilize janky platforming and physics to rid your enemies from this mortal coil.

I've played this games a fair amount of times with friends, online and offline, and it's always a great time.

156787259,english,"Apparently there is intentional input lag... in a game that already suffers from laggy servers that many people complain about (if you're one of the few that doesn't have lag, great for you, but that doesn't change this being the case for most).  This makes the game essentially a random button-mash fest.  Maybe it would still be decent for children who just mash a bunch of buttons and don't use any skill, but for parent-gamers playing along with their children, it is an exercise in frustration, which makes a game with low appeal even less appealing.

However, what really sours this game even further is the recent inclusion of a character from Cult of the Lamb, probably one of the most inappropriate games for children to be playing.  The game developers and/or publishers either don't seem to understand who their target demographic is, or are intentionally trying to shove demonic content in front of children's faces.  Unacceptable.  There are also other characters who can be unlocked after playing the game for some time which have similar demonic appearances.  Yet another increasingly common game that starts off all ""cute and kid-friendly"" but eventually descends into demonic garbage.

Too bad.  This title had the potential to be a fun little game to play with your kids, but it is ruined by unresponsive controls and the abhorrent inclusion of non-kid-friendly demonic characters.  Money wasted.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

156664437,english,"This game, is just a joy overall.

It's like Gang Beasts but generally better in almost every way. It's not just a free for all/team brawl, but it's also got different party modes where you have to work together as a team to do different objectives like collecting different candies, moving coal into your own train while trying to stop the other team from putting coal into theirs so your train goes faster, football/soccer, all the goodness. There's a decent amount of maps all with different gimmicks which keep the game fun to play.

A big upcoming upside is that specifically on Steam, you can give a ""Friend Pass"" to someone, so they can play the game for free with the caveat that they play at the same time as you. Seeing how this is a party game, that's not really much of an issue, and is a feature that more games like this should have as a default. The monetisation of the game is fine since there is nothing that would give you an advantage, just cosmetic stuff. Anything that can be bought in the store, even for the ""premium"" currency can be earned by exchanging the free earned currency, and at a rate that I've not had any real trouble with.

The game is fun and 100% worth the price. This is a fucking gem of a game, and pretty much any time it's brought up as something to play, it's almost always a yes.

Also! Additional maps are being added and I'm just generally really pleased with the game. I wanna see where it goes.

Instead of simply climbing a climbable thing, somehow we're grabbing and jumping? The two button climb took a minute to get used to, as the pseudo-drunk animation gives ambiguous feedback to whether you're succeeding.

156344048,english,"I hadn't heard about this game until a friend recommended it to me, I had absolutely 0 idea of what the game was about or what I was doing, here's what I'm thinking:

- There's no Battle Pass???
I mean, I don't understand if we're expected to all play with the same super extensive list of character selection? I mean, there's really nothing bringing me back week after week to spend my money on so I'm kinda lost? Do you just get all of it for free?

- MMR is Too Chaotic
The fluctuation between a game that plays like a Sunday drive then an MLG tournament the next gives me an emotional high I haven't experienced since grade school. I think a more defined leveling system will help balance out the playing field, also bots are cracked, valve plz fix. Also, no prestige option???

- My Face Hurts Everytime I Play.
I literally have too much fun that my cheeks are absolutely killing me by the end of the game, my face hurts too.

- There's a LOT of Achievements
I really can't ever choose which ones to focus on or what I should be paying attention to first, I just get really cool stuff all the time. I think this part of the game could be replaced with the battle pass.

That being said, very good game, excited to see if more animal options will be released!

Every unlockable cosmetic either costs too much of one of the forms of in-game currency, or requires ridiculous amounts of time spent playing to unlock.  The rewards of the leveling system are pathetic for the amount of grinding you have to do to level, and the experience needed to level up increases each time, resulting in diminishing returns.  And if you're not winning every single match, you're barely gaining any experience.  The game feels like a grind.  Not to mention, many of the rewards for leveling up are essentially worthless avatars, avatar frames, or emojis rather than characters or character costumes.  No one cares about unlocking emojis.

The core gameplay is fun but clumsy, and too many characters and costumes are locked behind leveling and the in-game shop.  How is that a good model for a casual family game?  Start being more generous with character and costume unlocks, and come up with some more character designs (try some new species besides cats and dogs; 9 variations of cats/dogs are more than enough).

156265723,english,"I really do enjoy this game, and don't get me wrong, i love this game to death, but there are some flaws, 
Here is a few that come to mind every single time I play:
 1. Weapons, while the weapons are fun to use when you obtain them and can be useful, they are far too powerful, and I believe they should be weakened in some way since obtaining one on a map that has a small boundary, or ice on the floor is pretty much a guaranteed victory. I also thing the weapons could be more balanced by making them break, or make the player holding the weapon drop it after so much use.
2.  When players die, they get the opportunity to throw items at the players still playing, I feel like this mechanic is a bit to overpowered and unfair. It essentially rewards the worse players, and punishes the more experienced players, I absolutley despise the fact that I could be dominating the match, but them all the dead players target me because, they know I am much more of a threat. WHile in the mean time, another player is picking up a weapon getting ready to launch all the surrounding group off the map, I love this game so much, but these things always manage to get on my nerves, even though these things still bother me I would never not recommend it to people looking to buy it

156119072,english,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1705437664,1705437664,TRUE,6,4,0.5234789848327636,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198440840852,156,16,1154,1002,69,1707069816

---- IT IS A GOOD GAME to play with friends online for a casual experiance for an hour or two, i'd never play this game outside of once a week at most.

Playing online is a mixed bag consisting of being up against chuck norris who can take on the world and
or complete idiots that have no idea what they are doing.

My complaints are so much time is wasted inbetween matches for 40 seconds ppl choose their characters - at this time you have NO IDEA what team your on or who your team mate is.

My opinion is this is a game that has the potential to be great if the devs give us new animals every month, new game modes and levels and keep with it; outside that this game isn't that deep to keep me coming back for more.
I feel like a training  area to practice beating up dummies and picking up weapons climbing n jumping would do wonders,

And although I could talk about many positive and negative things, for me the most important thing is to see how my parents, my girlfriend, people who are not interested in the world of video games, and who have little or no experience playing, had fun after about 5 to 10 minutes of adaptation, understanding controls and mechanics without problems, and forgetting about our family ties.

Fun, cute and easy to understand, needs more maps.

155281077,english,"When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?""
""Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer
To join the black parade""
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""
Sometimes I get the feelin'
She's watchin' over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall
The bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
A world that sends you reelin'
From decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call
To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
On and on, we carry through the fears
Oh, ah, ha
Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, ah, ha
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
Just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
You'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches, oh
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (we'll carry on)
Do or die, you'll never make me (we'll carry on)

7/10 solo

Have u ever wanted to release all ur pent up anger and frustrations? Well guess what, now u be an animal of ur choice and scrap with others for a living.
Whether you go full Bruce Lee with nunchuks on others, yeet them into poisonous gas, or drown them, this game has it all!

***Pros***
-The rag doll physics are funny
-Fun game with friends
-Skins aren't entirely locked behind a paywall
-Quick match variety of maps and game modes helps with repeatedly playing without getting boring fast
-Oh, you got insta KO'd after starting a match? Well, u can spectate and throw crap at others for revenge or even out of rage

***Cons***
-Maybe it's just a keyboard/mouse thing, but it sometimes feels like I am inaccurate with landing punches, headbutts, and precision grabs

-Variety of game modes that exist for Quick match do not exist for custom matches, unless I am blind and cannot find the right options (can't tell if this is the case, or if it's due to the 8 player capacity condition)

-Spectating after death is hit or miss with some maps. Some maps give u camera angles that do not view the maps entirety  and these angles make it hard for u to mess with others when tossing throwables

-The reticle for tossing things as spectator is inaccurate bc it doesn't account for throwable physics and environmental interaction. Hopefully this gets changed in the future, maybe an aiming arc is better rather than a reticle?

-Just a nitpick but, it feels like some animals have faster knockdown recovery than others.",1704358122,1704358122,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198087321670,0,5,1557,1,1033,1706683882

okay good now don't get me wrong this game is baller af: like mario party, super smash, human fall flat and gang beasts came together to have an orgy but the problem here: gacha is the uninvited guest and brought crabs.

aside from the gacha mechanic the in game store lacks cool permanent outfits: want a cool outfit for your favorite character? well have fun logging in daily just to check the store or grinding the game to level up.

what this game does do well is bring the fun with the wacky chaos.

155157508,english,"[h1]Shared/Split Screen Co-op sucks[/h1]

[h2]Connectivity problems[/h2]

Couch co-op interface is badly integrated. My friends and I tried out the game through Steam Remote Play (I assume it works the same as local co-op) and I haven't experienced such a lack of intuitive design in a while. Local co-op is ""technically"" online, as you can't play without an internet connection, but surprisingly no online players would ever join my hosted game. Split screen co-op is an absolute joke, we can't even play quick matches or join custom games.

[h2]Split Screen mess[/h2]

The actual splitting of the screen is terrible, a significant part of my monitor is being covered by black bars (yes, I made sure the resolution was correct). Such a simple game should have shared screen instead of split screen (similar to the Moving Out series as the experience was very smooth and pleasant).

[h2]Conclusions[/h2]

The idea of the game is very cute and entertaining but sadly it's not playable with friends unless everybody owns the game (and there goes the whole ""Shared/Split Screen Co-op"" advertisement). Personally, I don't think it's worth the price, even on sale. Having followed the development of the game since 2020, I am very disappointed and will probably request a refund.

154903142,english,"12 hours in, and I don't think I've ever laughed as much in a game as I have with this one.  It's ridiculous, challenging, hilarious, and engaging.

The biggest challenge is learning the controls, and how the game responds.  It's not as ""snappy"" as modern FPS's are, and the controls are on the ""soft"" side, in that you have to anticipate what you want to do and adjust for the wobbly physics.  That said, once you are a couple hours in, it all ""clicks"" and you will be hard pressed to find a more hilarious and literal laugh out loud game.

Pros:
- Fun and funny almost every round
- Easy to pick up, hard to master
- Lots of fun skins to unlock/earn
- Simple premise, slick interface
- No real thought required, great for blowing off steam
- Ridiculous in how the action plays out
- Good variety in the different levels/mini games

Cons:
- Slow loading times (for how graphically non-intense it is)
- Tutorial leaves out quite a lot such as running rolls, how to swim, etc...
- Replays in sports minigames are time wasters, as well as the winner ceremony (would rather it just jumps into the next game)
- Sometimes inconsistent ""grab""/""jump"" mechanics where very simple tasks are much harder than they feel like

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Giving it a negative review, but not returning the game because I think its very fixable and I hope they see this.

Further Insight:
- I don't like how I can't tell what I earn at each level or whether its random and I dislike how I only earn something every level. Sometimes I earn mtx currency, sometimes I earn a stupid profile thingy im never gonna use. Althewhile it takes several games to level up and I assume itll take even longer as I continue to level up.

1. If you enable local multiplayer (couch coop) then you can't play with others on internet. You are stuck with using the bots, and bots are really bad, they just follow you around and mimic your actions.
2. The split screen implementation is horrible, It leaves a lot of area as black space. I don't know why they didn't implement a single camera system that follows the players dynamically like Gang Beasts.

It's expensive normally, I don't think I'd ever pay $20, but $14? Yeah, sure.

The in-game currency is surprisingly very friendly. There are two currency types, and for the most part you can buy a lot of skins with the main currency you can earn just by playing the game, even the Holiday skins and IP Crossover skins. You can also earn the premium currency from playing the game, not as much as the main currency but still enough to buy a special skin if you save up.

Graphically I think the game looks very good, they get the fluffiness of the animals down pretty well.

The UI is clicky, responsive, and unique. It's not trying to fall into the modern interfaces a lot of other new games have done which I really appreciate.

154318562,english,"The problem with Party Animals is that you can easily get paired with a teammate who actively gets in the way of a win. Maybe that will change later, but for now you can't reliably know whether your team will help or hurt you.

I just finished a match in which my teammate literally went AFK after contributing nothing to our team. If you leave the game, you get a 2 minute ban from playing quickplay again. So the game punishes YOU when your teammate has given up and you leave the game because there's no chance of winning at that point. Pretty cool design flaw.

Also, it seems like some people might be cheating.

Devs kept putting out patches making constant changes to hitreg and how maps work. It isn't consistent and changes constantly which is annoying and doesn't always work properly.

I'm not sure if my game has glitched but for the past two days, I can't even collect my two box prizes of cookies. I've written in a help ticket but this limitation is irritating especially when level 100 players want to purchase new skins.

This game had potential but the Devs seem confused and don't know how to handle this game properly. For a while they implemented random 4x4 plays but people complained and they were removed. Why not just give us an option for that feature instead of forcing it upon players randomly?

These inconsistent and dumb decisions are destroying the game. They have less people playing now than Among Us. Among Us has been out for years! So that's very telling.

The gamemodes are fun. I really enjoyed the alternative party modes like Soccer and hockey and what not.

The main game is bland, again, compared to the Beasts. The levels are way to simple and act more as an arena in contrast to Gang Beasts more plop you in a location type of level design. The game doesn't seem to really benefit being a ""realistic physics sim"" ragdoll fighter type game. Movement just feels so constricting. I also greatly dislike the camera.

I'm not really looking to convey my thoughts properly in this review, just know that I really won't be playing this again.

I just feel like the controls won't respond to my orders when I do a headbutt or try to pick up stuff, even sometimes I'm punching someone's face but the player won't react, feels a bit cluncky, but the game is very fun anyways, you can always play with bots in custom lobbies if you're too bothered by tryhards or bad teammates and you can set the difficulty of each bot aswell.

It has a decent amount of maps but gets repetitive kinda quickly, I hope devs make more maps while they work on skin desings.

most maps need you to stay on a platform and not being thrown off by the other teams so its that simple.
matches last quite long until one team scores 3 wins. 
rewards are very basic too, you dont have customizations, you can unlock additional animals and each have different skins (outfits) or just different colors. you cannot mix outfits together like in headbangers or fall guys.
also keep in mind that the camera view is very close on your avatar, so you dont see the entire arena and theres no way to change it in the settings.

Between the private matches with friends, this game can be really fun and a lot of the problems can be ignored like the the online aspect of this game can be very broken.

Playing public matches all hits you throw out counts against you and every knockout hit you land on someone is converted onto you. Totally not made for dedicated public servers.
Game does not run properly half the time and starts a really bad stutter effect if you reach 30 fps and below.
I kinda can get the climbing aspect of this game where it's more simplified but a lot of the times it bugs out and just leaves you hanging or stuck in this infinite loop of bouncing off the wall, catching onto the same wall, climb up again, bounce off again then repeat until death.

Really to be honest. Gangbeast being a older game to this. Gangbeast is just a lot more better until a lot in this game can be patched out.
Give the devs a year longer with this game and it will be in a lot better state than now. Until then I am going to play Gangbeast.",1702167359,1702167359,FALSE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198010121604,0,15,990,0,767,1703123952

152963664,english,"incredibly rage-inducing even though it's supposed to be a casual family game. if you don't believe me, you probably haven't seen enough content creators play this game. everything about the game is executed well except for the combat system which is incredibly scuffed and inconsistent. for example, you can only reliably do a heavy punch with the right hook, it almost never does the left hook. i'm not sure if this is keyboard-exclusive, but either way, it makes the heavy punch about as worse as throwing haymakers. there's no settings to change this so it's the left hand instead that does heavy punches, i've searched the game settings several times, and there doesn't seem to be a way to control which hand throws the punch. another example is the grab feature, whether for climbing or for picking up objects. it never picks up reliably, and there's a 50/50 you have to try more than once to pick an object up. for climbing, it's absolutely insufferable; it's an okay feature for most of the maps, except for the ones where climbing is required to be the victor. on top of that, some weapons are nearly impossible to counter and only with a stroke of luck you can best them; there's very little skill involved in countering opponents with weapons because of how awkward the combat and movement is. 

another thing i don't really understand is the inability to have offline matches with ai or LAN. it's a basic feature most combat party games have, but this doesn't. you can make a custom match and the ai has three difficulties, but it has to be online. a waste of bandwidth if you want to play without encountering people targeting you because you are on a hot streak of three matches in a row where your randomly selected teammate is afk for the entirety of the game and only gets kicked in the dying seconds of the game because despite you reporting them as afk, the counter persists at counting down from 30 seconds. if your teammate is afk for any amount of time, you're pretty much crippled, which ruins the fun of the game where you work together to win. 

despite there being microtransactions, i don't see an issue with that being present. the currency you can buy is for buying cosmetics; no weapons or abilities are locked behind anything in this game. that being said, there's a lot of good things about this game, such as the music, the post-match photo, and the maps. the visuals are great too and run surprisingly well. they continue to add more characters and cosmetics, ever since the game was first released. 

a lot of people compare this to gang beasts for its graphics and combat, but i would say because of the additional mechanics in combat that differ it from that game, it has some extra downsides that make me enjoy gang beasts, but not this game. hopefully the combat and movement is adjusted eventually, because it makes the game incredibly unfun for a percentage of people. i encourage you to only purchase this game if you have a lot of friends to play with for custom matches, although the vast majority of achievements are locked behind quick-play(matchmaking) to prevent you from farming them since some unlock rewards. if you're achievement hunting, don't bother unless you want to spend most likely hundreds of hours for completion. if you're wanting to play for pvp, don't bother either, it's less pvp then most combat games because of the lack of control you have over most of your movements.

Pros:
Maps are very fun, my favorite being typhoon and the poison gas one. 
the rag doll physics make it even more fun, especially when your holding someone and they are pressing every button to get out.
Game runs very well, i have a decent computer and I can run almost 200 fps on it constantly
I like how you basically dont have to pay to get cool skins and other cosmetics.
very easy to get the hang of and be good at, kind of hard to master it tho
Cons:
Some times its hard to pick up weapons, and use them
Maps aren't very interactive, I mean this as the is just one main thing on the map to be on/off, and you can't really have a vantage point from some maps

Over all this game is definitely worth it if you like games like fall guys, gang beasts and other party style games, very worth the 20$

The game was made in Unity. The graphic is good. The game still fun even with this bad hit reg issue also If you thinking about being competitive in this game. You probably wrong, RNG always beat SKILLS.

MULTIPLE GAME MODE
Atleast not every game mode have a goal to Abuse all these animals (KO).
Would say few 4v4 team mode got something unique.

ANIMALS SELECTION VARIETY
There are multiple animal you can select even from starter. Once you progress a while you get more animals in your animal selection screen.

NOT MADE FOR COMPETITIVE (Bad precision)
Due to honky wonky janky Hit detection, Some of your hit won't register the worst case if you were too laggy. The game is very inconsistent with the hit reg and Knock out timing.

ASSIST: JANKY CROSSHAIR.
You can assist your teammate after you were fully Knocked Out. The jank at your crosshair not always aiming at correctly. Sometimes it went far off from your crosshair also even if you successfully/accidently hit someone it just either knocked out or not.

SKINS
You can get skin for free or paid (Microtransaction). I wouldn't recommend you spend $ on Nemo buck if you don't give any Funk about skins. The price is not worth and worst case that 
 Legendary skin almost double the base game price.

MTX (Microtransaction)
Only skins as for now. You can still play all game mode with no extra cost. The skin price is kinda bad especially the Nemo bucks. Nemo buck can acquire from Achievement and Leveling progress. All of these are one time reward once you reach Lv.100 you can't earn more unless buying with the garbage pricing.

GACHA / LOOTBOX
Ony for skins.  Skin for Legendary tier, Epic tier can get through here at rate 1.6%-ish. The Egg coins (Assuming the currency for gacha) use to get randomized skin. There is pity system for this where in every 70-spin if you haven't got any legendary you are guarantee to get 1. while Epic tier will always guarantee at every 10-spins. Oh yeah you can use Nemo Bucks for that too.

Way too hard to counter. 
Ends every match they spawn in.

My second place gripe - certain game modes are way too inconsistent.
Wind Tunnel is my #1 example. Whether or not someone dies in this mode is purely a dice roll.

I was also disappointed that it can only be played with 4 players locally. I specifically bought it because I loved Gang beasts and A gummy's life, and those both offer 8 player support. I got confused by the description of party animals and the reviews.. as it said 1-8 players. But now I realise that it's only 8 players online. Really disappointed after paying full price for it! : (
I never play it because I have 5-6 players most of the time. So sad!

Even if it did have 8 player local... it's so slow because of the online requirement... loading up local games really is annoying!

152517155,english,"Well... It was long and fun 60+ hours, but after two month from release i cannot recomend this game, and heres why:
1. Microtransactions and eggs. Some skins are available from shop for cookies, some for bucks. And some of them cost a-lot. One skin can cost more then game itself. One skin. ONE SKIN. And some skin, if im not mistaken, only available from eggs - lootboxes.I opened like more then 40 ( no money spend, only from in-game awards + buying some, for the bucks i got as reward ), and got a lot of duplicates ( like 3 or 4 from every 10 ) and 0 legendary skins.
2. Region locked skins. The game have a lack of skins i think. Some characters only have a few. And some skins you can get from out-game reward, like twitch drops, discord nitro etc. And at least once, there was a variant of skin ( color ) only available through chinese site, maybe it was some kind of local twitch alternative, idk. I think thats a bad practice...
3. Content update frequency. Recently, finally, devs give us some kind of roadmap. And said they plan to make a big updates - I didnt not understood what it will be, i mean a lot of content, like skins, maps, weapons etc, or just one thing from each category, like only one map, character, one collab skin, one weapon etc. If second variant - that would be bad. Cause frequency they promise is three month. From release we have a new map, for halloween, one new item and i think that it. For 2 month. And in-game shops, that updating big skins every week are in constant loop for now. Currently collab is Ori skins, and i think i saw it in shops like for 5 times already. Too repeative. 
4. Map perfomance optimization. Some map are ok about that, no problems at all. But on some there a little bit of problem. And one is a big problem - Gator Valley. My GPU is going crazy here, very hot and loud like im playing CP2077 on Ultra, especially in sequences with waves coming. 
5. Hit boxes and registration. From beginning i didnt have problem with that. But after recent updates, it feels like they broke something. Example: I was 1v1, opponent was with nunchucks. I waited for right moment and made jump kick with full stamina on him. And he fell on floor. But he didn't got knocked out. And he hit me with his nunchucks, and im died. And i saw moment like this as spectator quite a lot recently. Didnt happened before.
6? Battlepass. Game have battlepass. With 100 levels, skins, egg coins, bucks etc. And good question. What will be next? With next season. New battlepass would be free? Or, counting that fact that this game have in-game purchases, you would need to buy it? Some more content would be behind the paid-wall, in a premium game.

That leads me to a point, when after 60 hours, for 2 months, with small content updates, this game became boring. Same maps, no new skins, characters. And even fight system feels kinda broken now. I was hoping for this game to be better than that. Sad, cause i had some fun time with this game, but it looks like it's over.",1701267436,1701267436,FALSE,7,0,0.5619880557060241,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198059666214,679,53,4475,118,4010,1707083769

The game-play is varied from simple beat 'em up to hockey and train race. Each map has a unique variant to speed up matches, which help with longevity [only in beat 'em up games, so sport games can take forever sometimes]. The in game store is not as predatory as other games, and I've never felt inclined to purchase anything using real world cash. It has a nice balance of in-game currency that you earn and a ""rare"" currency that you earn doing challenges and through the battle-pass. The game also have a lot of references to things such as Half-Life, Star Wars, and even the movie Cats & Dogs [if it isn't a reference it is a very close coincidence] and it's funny to see them. Overall a good buy and would recommend it for groups of friends to beat each other up in a cute way. 

Now if they allow mod support so people can make their own maps and game-modes, it would make this THE best party game on Steam [in my opinion].

Thank you for the developers for listening, and taking their time to improve the tutorial and the game too.
Few things I wasn't happy that the global voice channel was turned on by default instead of just for teams and that the people several times attacked me who I was paired with (allies). That is something could be also added to the tutorial in the future as we share the goal to win the round.

I love the variety of lots of skins, that new areas added and the group kind of levels. 
The music is very fun, I like to listen on my playlist outside of the game too and I found it really cute that before the game starts, I can already mess around and push / move the letters in the recreate logo.

152156400,english,"Pretty fun little online brawler. Especially fun when queuing up with a friend or playing locally. Main problems as of writing the review: AFK players and skill disparity in the community. AFAIK the developers are trying to update the game to make matchmaking more fair, but chances are if you are a casual player and aren't really into the competitive aspect of the game (especially if solo queuing) you won't have a good time. Toxicity levels are manageable, some players will focus you (again, a much bigger problem when playing solo) but voice chat is mostly harmless in my experience. 

Regarding micro-transactions and skins: if you are putting hours into the game - you won't have to pay a dime for pretty much anything you want. I currently only know about 1 skin pack outright locked behind a paywall. Level rewards are generous and skins that cost normal currency are basically free, especially once you hit level 100. Paid currency drops in decent amounts from level ups, I never had to buy a skin for money and even managed to gift a fairly expensive skin. The issue may become worse (or better, actually) as more content is introduced and additional levels are added (though i'm not aware of developer plans to add more levels atm) 

All in all, if you like competitive online games that are a bit more random Party Animals comes recommended. Queue times are not long right now and the game is not annoyingly random (though this also kinda depends on the map). Skillful players will outmatch luck 90% of the time, i'd say. Bugs are basically non existent, which is also a big plus.

-Gamebreaking bugs
-Annoying glitches
-Ingame store with single items priced higher than full game price
-poor optimization (high end graphics card running at 90%)
-virus or crypto miner built in the game ( probably )
-censorship heavy ( word angry is censored )
-ban heavy ( griefing, language use despite the censorship, canceling matchmaking penalty) 
-unstable/ poor server performance ( half a second delay with 20 ping)
-toxic voice chat randoms (there is no punishment for voice chat abuse/harassment, but text messages are all saved and can be used against you)
-AI games, without giving you a choice to leave without penalty as well as hiding the fact that you are playing against AI.

152115129,english,"Overpriced 5$ max price is fair. glitches vary from game-breaking to mildly annoying. So many glitches its impossible to tell if anyone is cheating. Glitches like stamina either completely drained or not draining at all or death from 1 punch to not dying when you should have. Some instances game will put you in game with AI and not even tell you are playing with an AI. But AI is bad so if you are not as blind as my friends that I bought this game for, you will notice. 
Because of the in-game shop should be a free game. Consider some skins ( pixels ) cost more than the game itself ( more than 18$ for one ingame visual item is a scam) I am not even talking about the poor optimization of the game itself that it needs to use 80% of the high end graphics card to render this basic looking 3D game. I truly suspect it has a crypto miner built in. As well as the unstable connection regarding delay of .5 sec sometimes there and sometimes isn't, while the ping difference is only 10 ms. Most likely the servers are partially peer-to-peer, this would explain occasional broken games with 1 frame per 3 seconds that everyone in the server experiences the same. Censorship in the game is certainly worth a mention. Despite the censorship, week bans are a common occurrence as well.
Conclusion: Game should be free and most likely contains virus/crypto miner.",1701030981,1701030981,FALSE,75,10,0.5586893558502197,10,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561199575012596,0,1,466,0,397,1701218255

151989915,english,"This game is for a certain type of person, and that person is not me. The controls are purposefully janky as all hell and the camera is also an absolute nightmare (uncertain if that was also intentional). These two things, when combined with the absolute chaos of this game's game play, gives me a whirlwind of motion sickness. Beyond this, there were several other things I disliked about the game that have been covered extensively in other reviews, including a gacha mechanic and paid skins (in a game I already paid $20 for...) and confusing mechanics that aren't clearly explained; for example, sometimes you get knocked out for all of 5 seconds, and other times you get knocked out for what feels like a full minute. 

The terrible controls also just irritated me to no end instead of being amusing. I don't want to grab onto the side of a train when I'm trying to grab coal to feed into the engine. I don't want to spend 45 seconds attempting to pick up a frying pan while dodging arrows, taser bolts, and unicorns diving at me with plungers. Some of the game modes are also insanely annoying and the round-based modes in particular can either be frustratingly short or agonizingly long depending on the skill level of your teammate and opponent. 

I see the appeal of this game, I really do. The graphics are very good, each of the animals is insanely adorable, the music is cute, and there are moments of frenetic chaos that occasionally made me laugh out loud, but this was offset by the constant weariness and groans of frustration I was letting out after losing a match because my teammate and I both got immediately KO'd by a gorilla with a tennis racket, or because I spent 75% of a match dead due to people just spamming grabs and throwing me off the side of a train, or froze to death in the Arctic Ocean because the gimmicky controls and stamina system made me do something I wasn't trying to do instead of climbing to safety. 

If this all sounds like a rip-roaring good time to you, then you'll probably enjoy this game, and I did find it occasionally enjoyable in short spurts; however, the amount of motion sickness and annoyance the game caused me did not give me any desire whatsoever to continue playing it and I ended up refunding it.

The game comes packaged with a variety of animals to choose from (with the only downside being that some animals/skins of animals are region-locked or exclusive to certain events making it unlikely to 100% collect every character there is), a bundle of maps with different modes to fight or cooperate on, and achievements that will keep you invested in the game for the long run. However, this is all offered at the beginning of its a launch. With this, along with a few updates from time-to-time, the game can feel a bit stale here and there. There are also times where fighting does feel a bit RNG, landing hits that have no impact or brushing punches that result in a knockout that stuns you for too long.

151415521,english,"Party Animals is a fun game with creative levels and cute characters you can earn through leveling, including additional costumes that can be earned through achievements or the shop as well. So in that sense, there is a lot of variety in which a player can choose and earn through progression.

However there is a lot of unexplained bs I find myself experiencing the longer this game exists and I play it. I'm discovering I mostly experience this on a handful of last stand maps which include Ichiban, Winter Is Coming, Wind Tunnel, and Gator Valley. Ichiban seems to suffer from irregular and varied windows in which the player will be instantly knocked out from a punch or item used by another player. Not to mention it feels I have significantly less time to jump back up out of the gas than others players do, even dying within a second after losing consciousness regardless if I did before I was thrown down there. Winter is Coming is one of the most bs levels I've played given it seems I freeze a lot quicker than others players do at the end game while they can get up instantly or roll back without ever freezing at the end way too often to not be noticed. I see this happen on variety of other levels as well mentioned above at times including a handful of team levels. I don't know if that's due to anything in particular but it's becoming more apparent the longer I own this game.

Because of that alone, I find myself playing this game less and less due to the bs luck people get in general. As mentioned, they are able to wake from knockouts, get back onto ledges, or even roll back into play before timeouts on various levels way quicker than I can. I don't want to hear the ""lack of skill"" and that kinda crap. I've played this game during Beta over 20 hours including the version from a couple years ago. It wasn't this bad at the start but you notice it more obviously the longer you play, whether a session or playing the game for a number of weeks. I'm seeing a game become less fair in non team games the longer I play this game. Sadly that means it's becoming a crappier product unless it's 4v4 a lot of the time to balance out the unexplained bs.

Would I recommend the games? Yes. However I can't say I tend to have much fun outside of 4v4s with a friend as randoms are insufferable to deal with as your team mates in a 2v2 setting or the fact they expect you to fully carry them.",1700772483,1700772483,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198510670499,0,3,1496,0,1214,1703949032

The main issue with this game is the fact it's online only with no offline support. It also features a timed store with loot boxes for anyone who has a problem with fear of missing out. However, there's plenty of base cosmetics through achievements & player levels to not be too much of a concern unless you're a collector or like certain crossovers.",1700686031,1700686031,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198031261254,492,22,1613,15,1374,1706985662

151119298,english,"pros
fun with friends
that really where it ends with pros now here are the con and where it becomes a pain in the ass
2 minute quick match ban
this game is not competitive like CSGO why is this even here lemme just play and this will also still happen if your teamate leaves or is a bot nor you cant leave in the map vote or character selection screen either and i see what the creators are trying to do but its all in like a 30 minute ban or none. not a 2 minute thats right in the middle which does nothing. if you need to leave a game but dont want quick match ban just disconnect your internet wait for the game to kick you out then reconnect and no ban most of the time and when it does happen it shows that disconnect because of internet issues causing a quick match ban
voting system
lemme just plays the gamemodes i want instead of a voting system wheres its the same few maps over and over
broken gamemodes conveyor takes way to long per round i could leave at the start and by the time the quick match ban is over that round would be in the last 30 seconds
trebuchet enemies take way to long to knockout just for them to wake up in one second instead of a river between i would reccomend a pit so there is not getting back out of the river
winters coming same as conveyor takes too long
RNG and weekly shop system
if you like a skin well too bad it either has to show up in shop which only repeats every 3 weeks or get it from the gacha RNG system which is mostly repeats too
custom exclusive maps
i have no friends that play this game and i bet most people dont or atleast not enough to comprise of a full match in the better gamemodes such as the bar fight and subway
totorial barly teaches anything thing
it does not teach you many feature that can be very helpful
lag issue
could just be me but for some reason every round there atleast a ping spike where my ping goes to 2 thousand and makes the game unplayable for 5 to 10 seconds which is enough time to determine who win and who loses
this game should not be worth 20 dollars for a broken and still heavily unfinished game
dont think i need to explain this just get it when its on a discount
devs lying about what would be in the game upon release
still dont think i need to explain this
every update is 6 months apart from each other and if its quicker than that its usually a new skin\
just dont get this game heres another thing i never actually enounter hackers but i bet if you were to hack the game the devs would take 6 months to patch that
side note ( if you win too much or are to good at the game you will more likely be getting players that are afk or AI. and also just recently i got a quick match ban for no reason i did not even leave in the middle of a match not even at all maybe it was bc of spam reports or suspected hacking but it feels like if you win too much the game will screw you over)",1700678461,1706386707,FALSE,0,1,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198379130804,0,2,5592,1268,4736,1707086180

Pros: 

[list]
    [*]Great character design and visual fidelity
    [*]Fitting soundtrack and sound design
    [*]Maps with varied objectives and excellent core gameplay
    [*]Fast matchmaking and nice UI
    [*]Low skill floor/high skill ceiling
[/list] 

Cons:

[list]
    [*]Hitboxes and hit detection seem inconsistent
    [*]Items are moderately imbalanced
    [*]Microtransactions are fairly expensive for a P2P game
    [*]Solo players get matched against premade teams
    [*]AFK detection takes too long
[/list] 

The devs originally advertised you being able to play the game offline and attributed this inaccuracy to a translation error from Chinese to English. The game's current overall rating reflects this dissatisfaction with lack of an offline/local mode reminiscent of traditional party games like Mario Party, Super Smash Bros, and Jackbox.

Personal View:
1º -----
I didn't like much the shop, and I still don't like it. I accept the developers need money to keep the updates and servers, but the price of the nemo bucks are too high sadly.
They don't update much the shop, is always the same skins in a loop.

2º-----
When you reach lvl 100 you will only get cookies (the ""not valuable"" coin of the game), but at that point you can already have all the cookie purchable skins on the shop and the locker, which make them useless. 
Because you don't get any reward when you already have all archivements and all possible skins (without paying more money), It make the game more boring, knowing that no matter if you win or lose, you will not get anything.
The only moment I had to use my cookies where during hallowen event (2 skins on the shop with a price of 18.000 and 25.000 cookies aprox) and the lunar festival (1 skin of 25.000 aprox)
I ocasionally play because I like the game but the lack of new rewards, at least egg coins or nemo bucks, make the game not so exciting. It is good for an hour of fun with friends tho. 
At the moment of this review I have 986K cookies, I hope one day I can do something with them.

3º-----
The gacha machine, Is the worst friendly gacha I ever seen. To use it you need egg coins (a special coin that you only get on events or lvl up between 1-100) or you can use nemo bucks (1200 nemo bucks = 13€ more or less)
You, ofc, will get a lot of common and uncommon rewards instead of epic and legendary, that's normal.
The thing of getting only cookies when you get repeated skins is just **** , you get a useless coin compensation for wasting a ""valuable coin"" that can cost money. That will make everyone not want to play the horrible gacha machine with money EVER. Bad Strategy. At least give something like a ""coin fragment"" so people can try again every X tries on the machine.

Could be because of the turn based combat, the whole ""throw the dice"" system that's omnipresent from start to finish, or because I thought that speccing and finding the right build for your character was a massive headache. None of that mattered in the end. These prejudices, these ""cons"" I had quickly turned into qualities I now seek when choosing my next game to play. I grasped the basics of BG3 during my very first fight and never felt the need to use a single guide (be it for my gear or the gameplay in general.)

Seriously, trust the Metacritic score and the Steam reviews.
I never play a game twice, even the games I consider to be my absolute favourite. This being said, I'll now start my second playthrough.

The endearing animal assets showcase the developers' meticulous attention to detail, adding a charming touch to the overall gameplay. While the initial price point may be a consideration for some, the engaging content and adorable characters make it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a fun multiplayer experience.

It's important to note that supporting the game financially through the purchase of Nemo-bucks contributes to its ongoing development and the introduction of new skins. However, recognizing the diverse player base, it would be wonderful to see more opportunities for casual and low-budget players to access the full game experience without feeling obligated to spend additional money. Striking a balance between supporting the developers and ensuring inclusivity for players with varying budgets would undoubtedly enhance the overall appeal of Party Animals.

Despite this consideration, the developers have undeniably poured significant effort into creating a captivating environment.

150208354,english,"I would only recommend this game if you have friends to play it with. Combat-wise, it used to take one punch or dive kick to knock out your opponent, which being on the opposing side would take a good 30 seconds to recover. After updates, hard blows and dive kicks seem to do almost nothing to the opponent, and when you do knock them out it still takes forever to recover. Two-handed weapons have no balance factor whatsoever, and the fact you can kill opponents with weapons alone is unacceptable. Each map, at least the Free for All maps, have their own ways of eliminating opponents, so you shouldn't have to resort to beating someone with a shovel or frying pan to death. Combat, surprisingly, is the least of my worries with this game.

I understand we're on the internet, and from time to time I come across some weird stuff and weird people, but with all the matches I've played I'm extremely appalled with the usernames and messaging that comes up on this game. I'm talking about racist, homophobic, sexist, and any other derogatory terms or phrases that come up in quick matches, and out of a handful of usernames I've had to report as inappropriate to moderation, they only got back to me on only 1 of them. While I understand that building a community is important, and every gaming community with games like these has their toxic side, they could do SO MUCH BETTER with their moderation.

What can I say that's good about the game? Well, before any updates, when I tried the tutorial the controls were easy to understand, but after the update they never went over moves that are critical to the game, like the dive kick for example. You can earn XP in Custom Matches, unlike in other games I've played with friends, so that's a plus. I like most of the outfits released for each character, although I wish I could mix and match the skins with the outfits instead of unlocking each combination separately. I wish I had anything else to say about this game on better note. I really wanna fall in love with this game, but if the player finds themselves relentlessly infuriated, I can't say this is a great game.

Like I said, this is a game meant for close friends and not for taking on complete strangers. You never know who you're gonna run into in these matches, and they could totally be using malicious behavior from playing dirty to saying something dirty. That said, even if you're playing with close friends, it wouldn't surprise me to see friendships getting shattered over a game like this because it's easy to get upset when someone is chasing you with a set of nunchucks and beating the hell out of you with them.

My personal rating for this game would be a 4/10. I see the potential and the positives, but it just gets overshadowed by the number of problems this game had before it even got released. I had a lot of hope for this game, and I hate to see most of that hope getting drowned out by anger and frustration. With that said, if you choose to spend the money to play this game, just remember...it's just a game, not your life.",1700115321,1700115321,FALSE,1,0,0.5016198754310607,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198091117580,0,2,4556,0,3461,1705643825

PLEASE LIKE AND SHARE THIS IF YOU AGREE AND MAYBE THE DEVS WILL SEE AND FIX IT

I played this game about the first 2-3 weeks non-stop and i loved it. i could not stop laughing whilst playing with friends. accidentally knocking each other out or just fighting against your friends because they're on a different team was my highlight of the best things the game had to offer and i bet most people would agree. 

Now, I came back to the game about a month later and noticed that if you que up a game with more than 3 friends in your party it makes all maps 4v4 and no longer a 2v2v2v2. This ruins the game! it completely changes the pace of the game and makes it flat out boring. its slower and a lot less action is happening. i literally ended up turning on my team mates / friends and sabotaging them because i was so un-entertained. i played about 3 matches before getting so bored i just got off to play mw3. Although i see why the devs made this change. They didn't want 3 or more friends queing into a game together and teaming against other teams of 2, 
making it a 4v2v2. but i still think even if that's happening its not worth Entirely changing the pace of the game so that the 4v2v2's stopped occurring. 

I no longer think the game is fun and will uninstall after i post this, and i bet a huge portion the player base for this game has already done or are going to do the same! I almost wish i could refund and get my money back.

Not a whole lot needs to be said really about the core game itself, what you see in the screenshots and video on the store page sums it up very well, its a simple game, don't think too much about it. Just goofy looking animals beating the crap out of each other on different maps, game has a bunch of skins (Yes it has microtransactions) that you can unlock by simply playing, the microtransactions don't seem to be too bad, from what I can tell you can unlock any skin for free but it'll be roughly 70% of skins at which point you hit a road block.

It does have some flaws though, here they are.

1. You can select your server/region, that's great! Unfortunately the game often likes to completely ignore what server you have selected and instead puts you in a random server on the other side of the planet for seemingly no reason. Its frustrating and needs fixing, so far no response from the developers.

2. The achievements are bad, like REALLY bad, some achievements require you to play custom games with friends, good luck if you play this game solo, there's lots of achievements that have silly requirements like this, very poorly designed. The devs seem to think everyone plays this game in local co-op or has 8 friends to play with. Why is this an issue? Because many skins are locked behind achievements, see that skin you like? You're not getting it, awesome right?

3. Leaving game nets you a two minute time penalty from playing the game again, the developers think this is some highly competitive game, now I get the idea behind this there's just one problem, remember point one? About how the game puts you in the wrong region? Yeah well if the game does that and you leave because you don't want to play with 300 ping (What sane person does?) then enjoy the punishment.

4. The game is extremely inconsistent, say you get knocked into the icy water, one time you get in the water and literally one second later you're frozen (AKA dead) but another time it gives you like five seconds, there is zero consistency here and you're at the mercy of whether the game hates you or not. The other issue with this is that there is ZERO indication of how long you can be in these dangerous areas, the game severely lacks information for the player.

5. The camera isn't very good, its WAY too zoomed in and there are absolutely no options to change camera settings, strange because on some maps the camera likes to zoom out far, the camera is completely borked, we seriously need camera options, its bad, like real bad.

That's really it for my major flaws, other than this, game is excellent but I'm not too sure how much the developers care about the feedback, hopefully these things are addressed in the near future.",1699894633,1699894797,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198057900572,0,28,2133,0,715,1705827235

From the moment I dove into the wacky world of floppy animals, I was hooked, and it's been a non-stop rollercoaster of laughter and enjoyment ever since.

First and foremost, Party Animals boasts a delightful and charming visual style that's sure to put a smile on your face. The adorable, physics-based animals are incredibly expressive, and their floppy movements are as comical as they are endearing. It's impossible not to giggle as you watch your clumsy character stumble, flop, and tumble through the various game modes and environments.

The game offers an impressive array of game modes and maps, each with its own unique set of challenges and absurdity. Whether you're duking it out in melee combat, engaging in team-based antics, or attempting to overcome obstacle courses, Party Animals keeps the excitement levels cranked up to 11. The maps are creatively designed, offering a perfect blend of chaos and strategy.

What truly sets Party Animals apart is the sheer unpredictability and uncontrollable mayhem that ensues when you and your friends are thrown into the mix. The physics-based gameplay leads to hysterical and often bizarre moments that you'll be reminiscing about long after you've logged off. It's the kind of game where friendships are tested, rivalries are formed, and everyone gets a chance to bask in the glory of their ludicrous victories and defeats.

The customization options are a fantastic touch, allowing you to dress up your animals in all sorts of zany outfits, adding an extra layer of hilarity to the gameplay. It's a blast to see your friends' ridiculous fashion choices and accessories in action during the games.

The online and local multiplayer options work seamlessly, ensuring that you can enjoy the madness with friends near and far. The matchmaking system is quick, and the netcode is stable, which means you'll spend more time laughing and less time waiting.

The developers have done a stellar job of keeping Party Animals fresh with regular updates and new content, demonstrating their commitment to creating a thriving and enjoyable community around the game.

In conclusion, Party Animals on Steam is an absolute riot, a carnival of laughter, and one of the most enjoyable multiplayer party games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. If you're looking for a game to entertain your friends, family, or even strangers online, look no further. It's an unforgettable experience that guarantees a night full of belly laughs and good times.

149720926,english,"In the world of video games, there are countless options available to players seeking entertainment and excitement. However, Party Animals is not one of them. This game falls short in terms of creativity, gameplay mechanics, and overall enjoyment.

Firstly, Party Animals lacks originality. The concept of animals engaging in various party activities may seem appealing at first glance, but it quickly becomes monotonous. The game fails to introduce new challenges or innovative features that would keep players engaged for an extended period.

Moreover, the gameplay mechanics are incredibly repetitive. The tasks assigned to players are limited and quickly become predictable. Whether it's racing against other animals or engaging in simple mini-games, the lack of variety makes Party Animals a tedious experience.

In conclusion, Party Animals fails to deliver an exciting and engaging gaming experience due to its lack of originality, repetitive gameplay mechanics, and overall lackluster presentation.

149658363,english,"A Fun and Laid-Back Multiplayer Experience

I feel compelled to share my thoughts on Party Animals because, despite the mixed feedback it has received, I genuinely believe it's a pretty good game. It's important to note that many of the negative reviews may be related to misconceptions about local play, as the game actually requires an online connection. However, this shouldn't overshadow the fact that Party Animals offers a decent gaming experience.

The game's core loop revolves around a series of mini-games and fight rounds in a team format, with team sizes varying between two and four players based on the random matchmaking system. The standout feature is its ragdoll combat mechanics, which some might dismiss as purely luck-based. However, with practice, it becomes apparent that the game can be highly competitive when facing skilled opponents. While luck does play a minor role, mastering skills like quick weapon pickups, accurate drop kicks, and strategic player tossing depends more on player skill and feedback.

Admittedly, the game's progression can feel repetitive over extended play sessions, making it better suited for shorter, more casual gaming sessions. The inclusion of a free battle pass system is a nice touch, and despite the presence of microtransactions, I never felt pressured to make any purchases. Most of the items available for purchase are cosmetic, and the game generously provides free players with plenty of skins and items.

Like any online multiplayer game, the Party Animals community can be a mixed bag, with elements of toxicity and competitiveness, but it also has its share of friendly and helpful players. Ultimately, I'd recommend Party Animals to anyone looking for a simple, laid-back game where you can goof around without taking things too seriously.

In conclusion, Party Animals offers a fun and enjoyable gaming experience, especially for those seeking a relaxed multiplayer environment with moments of hilarity and skill. Give it a try, and you might be pleasantly surprised by what it has to offer.",1699288440,1699288512,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198072847564,131,1,13628,517,6259,1707110083

149560735,english,"i'll be honest, this game is kinda rough around the edges, but i'm having fun with it.

its a game i get on every week to do weekly challenges. i'm on that GRIND. theres a comprehensive level up path with tons of cosmetics and in-game currency.

and the cosmetics are actually good. every skin looks amazing and adorable.

its an easy game to play once every couple weeks if you just wanna have fun with friends.

but for that GRINDSET MINDSET grinders like me who does the weekly xp challenges can attest to how annoying it is to get certain challenges done.
ranging from knock outs with certain weapons not tracking, to literally not getting the one gamemode you need because everyone votes for LTS, challenges can kinda be stressful.

weapon challenges ESPECIALLY suck. like one weekly challenge that was used is getting 15 knock outs with the bat weapon. it literally never tracked one week. then comes the Halloween event and lo and behold you have to get 15 more knock outs. thankfully they lowered it down to THREE.

praying to RNjesus hoping you get those weapons is so annoying. like just make the challenge get knock out with weapons. that's a lot more intuitive. i have a heart attack each time i see the weapon i need for a challenge because its always a 50/50 gamble the game decides to let you pick it up.
sometimes the physics engine works against you. like climbing up walls like 30% of the time doesn't work. it feels like your punches just glide off people (this sucks in ball modes).

and for the love of god: let us decide what gamemodes we want to queue in.
let us at least pick from LTS or team score. it makes weeklies so much easier.
and bring back 4v4 LTS. it's a lot more fun than 2v2v2v2, dont @ me

despite all my gripes with the game, i still like it.

149452406,english,"Despite the issues on launch, Party Animals has become my go-to for arcade brawling. It's fun, exciting, and looks amazing in terms of graphics. The way that the game balances skill and luck feels reminiscent of Super Smash Bros. or Mario Kart, where while the most skilled players will have the upper hand most of the time, the underdogs always have a chance to win big. The way that the game frames each KO with a satisfying thwack and slowing of time really gives your brain a dopamine rush that lots of other games don't replicate.
The progression in the game is steady and consistent, with the ""battle pass"" steadily drip-feeding you with money and skins to keep you invested. I personally love how even though you can unlock most skins in the battlepass, there's still the option to unlock them early if they go on the store's rotation. While some have pointed out the lootbox/gacha mechanic that exists, its never really pushed on the player to spend money on it as there are 2 other ways to get skins without having to pay up.
If there's one thing to not like about the game, its the poor local multiplayer implementation and always-online requirements. While I don't do couch co-op a lot, many people have bought this game specifically for that and were sorely dissapointed. The split screen is lazy with it not filling up the entire display, and you can't even play on the go since you have to always be connected to the internet. I won't judge the game because of this, but I do wish that the developers would be far more open about it as well as more motivated to fix the shortcomings rather than let them be. Every other aspect of the game is perfect, and these issues just hold it back a bit.

If you're looking for a couch co op masterpiece, this isn't it. However, if you don't care about that and you love games like Gang Beasts, this is it for you. With a well designed balance between skill and luck, this is easily one of the best party games of the year.

149354364,english,"Party Animals is one of those non-committal games for when you want to have some silly fun with friends. It takes mere minutes to get the hang of and can support up to 8 players between humans and AI. There are quite a few maps and different game modes to experience, each with their own quirks and gimmicks. Get eliminated? Don't worry! After you're defeated, you'll spectate the rest of the round and influence it by throwing objects to disrupt the remaining active players.

This game does not have a high skill cap so it's not one you can really dedicate to and enjoy if you're just out to win. Its low skill entry and accessibility make it a true party game. If you're just looking for mindless fun with friends, win or lose, Party Animals does not disappoint.

The Pros:
+ Silly, mindless fun with up to 8 friends.
+ Low skill entry means anyone can be playing in minutes.
+ Gameplay and controls are quite smooth.
+ Very stable; I've not experienced any crashes.
+ Vast multitude of cosmetics and achievements. While microtransactions exist for cosmetics and characters (which are essentially skins themselves), they are mostly optional as just playing the game grants you in-game currency over time. There are zero pay-to-win aspects.

The Cons:
- To get the most out of this game, it's best to have friends playing. While doing Quickplay will get you into matches fast, having a group of friends to laugh with while you beat the crap out of each other really amplifies what this game provides.
- Everything requires online play; there are no offline lobbies, though games can be locked and played only with AI if desired. Losing internet makes the game unplayable.
- Reportedly, leaving Quickplay matches is harshly and overly penalized, though I've not utilized Quickplay myself to elaborate further.
- Due to how fast games can be with the current map roster, gameplay can get repetitive. Playing with different groups and cycling the game modes help to alleviate this.

All-in-all, treat Party Animals as it was meant to be; as a party game to play occasionally with people, not one to no-life and ""get good at."" Do that, and it will bring hours of laughter and countless moments to remember. I can't recommend it enough so long as you have group(s) to play it with.",1698904599,1699037043,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198043417150,243,12,1844,0,1526,1702966488

One-sided maps such as Ichiban and Ice Breaker are downright infuriating as a majority of the time, whoever got the weapon wins the round. The poison and Ice on various maps is frustrating as there is zero way of telling if you will suffocate or freeze. Every time you get knocked off you roll the dice on whether you die or scramble back to safety.
The more overpowered weapons causing issues have already been nerfed and even with the recent changes I can't see weapon nerfs getting to the root of the problem, which is how random suffocating, getting ko'd, or freezing feel. If we could see how much health we have. Perhaps in place of the stamina drain on your name tag it shows health instead. That way you know when a situation is too dangerous instead of having life dangled in front of you only to be snatched away because a shovel hit you one too many times.

TLDR: Add a health bar.

While we're at it: 
Add 4v4 as a mode you can vote for alongside map vote and add Final Destination + Winter Cabin to queue.

Original review included below:

There are a myriad of issues plaguing the game which personally makes it hard to recommend buying it in its current state. I really do enjoy playing, but game bugs are frustrating and spoil the experience. However, I'm glad there is transparency about issue reporting on the [url=https://forum.partyanimals.com/t/bug] official game forums. [/url]

Party Animals is a fun team-based minigame extravaganza. Together with a team of 2-4, you hop into various minigames with silly and wonky physics to win new costumes, animals and other customization options. Across three game modes, you compete against each other on various different maps with fun little gimmicks.
If you've played CS(:S) minigames and Mario Party before, this game is definitely something fun for you!

Although the issues below can be seen as minor, the ones that I've experienced at least a multitude of times are:

[list]
    [*]Physics engine object issues such as the [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/iceberg.mp4] iceberg bits in Ice Breaker [/url] and [strike] [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/bomba_bridge.mp4] Beat-Up Bridge [/url] [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/another_bomba_bridge.mp4] spazzing out [/url] [/strike] resolved)
    [*]Hands / paws targeting issues such as grabbing onto players in range and  [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/grabbing_issues_2.mp4] climbing [/url]  [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/grabbing_issues.mp4] structures [/url]
    [*]Audio/visual issues such as camera in terrain clipping, [url=https://storage.googleapis.com/rebos_american_hamburger_stash/camerabug.mp4] random camera snapping [/url], game audio drop-outs, erroneous sound effects, layer synchronization and mixing
    [*]Game rewards issues such as problems gifting friends items, and tracking, redeeming off-platform game rewards

For the average player these issues probably aren't problematic, especially if you're just looking to have fun with friends. If you're looking to unlock as many animals and customization options as possible though, issues like these can be seen as frustrating as they can hinder your efforts.
I hope that game issues will be resolved over time. I will change my review accordingly when improvements are made!",1698762183,1702740938,FALSE,2,0,0.5199999809265136,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198058717653,311,27,7704,424,4646,1707092956

I don't see any party, where's the party?

The hitbox is a mystery

Too competitive
Not every game is about win or lose, who says dogs and cats can't be friends?
If animals can work together in a friendly way to overcome some challenges instead of beating  s h i t  of each other

This inconsistency spreads elsewhere, one second I'm tossing someone in the ice and they swim for a good 3 seconds, climb up, get knocked down in the water and are able to climb out once more, then if I get pushed off within those 3 seconds I'm froze, there are many examples of this and it makes the game very unfun when at its core it's a pretty enjoyable party game with some really fun games, but it's just too much, maybe in future updates......but I have a weird feeling that this is something that'll remain very much the same game with no major QoL changes or updates made but I'd like to be wrong and I'd like to change my review if those things happen along with it.",1698547012,1698547012,FALSE,83,13,0.6193295717239379,7,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198039811624,0,1,3330,0,3122,1703921328

the people are rude and toxic in game and the game modes are basic and boring. the achievements in the game are either basic and easy or stupidly hard for a tiny reward; other achievements would take ages of boring game play with no way to do it faster, just takes ages and that's it. the achievements in this game suck.
 the characters them self are mediocre and they don't have many skins and the only skins you can get are lame and the good ones are very rare and sometimes lame ones are also rare,so if you got a rare one, you could just get a lame one instead.
 every update is another way for the developers to make the game a little bit worse in the name of ""balance"" but just end up making the game less fun and ruining the whole point. like when they decided to get rid of the fish over and over again, then completely swap it for something else. the whole point of the fish was to give the dead players a way to still do stuff, but they keep trying to take that way from people. they also like a lot of RNG. each time you punch someone it does random damage.",1698404883,1705789742,FALSE,1,0,0.5034558176994323,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561199003527991,0,7,8137,0,8137,1705789079

148875400,english,"Editing this to be at least a little bit more helpful rather than just a scrubquote:

The game is fun, absolutely, but there are two (edit, now 4) things that make it unbearable to play online for more than one or two matches at a time unless you want to play custom lobbies with a group of friends that aren't as sweaty as random people on the internet:
[olist]
    [*] [b]Lack of feedback when engaging with any of the combat mechanics.[/b] You’ll struggle when throwing a punch, performing a dive kick, headbutting and when lifting someone else up, constantly, all the time. There’s no way of telling if your running punch will throw someone into the stratosphere or your character is just going to rub their hairy fist all over your opponent’s face, nor will you ever tell if your dive kick is going to connect or you’re getting KO’d by someone else’s face the second you touch them midair, or much worse, get KO'd by the floor right next to them, setting you up to get grabbed and thrown off at any arena type map. Even at full stamina, everything is just guesswork. 
Oh yeah also good luck grabbing someone with both hands first try when everyone in the lobby is trying to kick your face.

    [*] [b]A matchmaking system that throws you against anyone, anywhere, completely disregarding your set region and much less your amount of skill.[/b] I’m South American, so I set my region to that. It’s already bad we all get lumped up in servers run in the single country that doesn’t speak the same language as most of the continent does, but that’s irrelevant considering that in 1 out of 3 matches I get sent to the States anyways, with 150 to 200ms of ping, making interactions with anything close to impossible. And even if I do get a good match, I’ll get my party filled with a random who just installed against 3 teams of experienced players, either that or I get to fill on 4v4 against a full premade team.

    [*] [b]Random chance things just kill you on knock down.[/b] Threw a dive kick on round start? Die. It's that simple. If someone happens to graze your head as you fly by, you could just die. Get crushed? Die deader. There's no way to prepare for this, just pray that god will not smite you this round.

    [*] [b]Matchmaking penalties leave you locked to the queue even if it didn't yet find a match.[/b] You know what's so fun of casual games? Getting locked in matches where you have to just play the same map for the 5th time, or even better, getting a matchmaking penalty for joining and leaving the queue ""too quickly."" If you're gonna FORCE me to play matches in maps I don't even want to play, give me a rank or something, because that's just competitive queue.

148833090,english,"Party Animals is a fun game with creative levels and cute characters you can earn through leveling, including additional costumes that can be earned through achievements or the shop as well. So in that sense, there is a lot of variety in which a player can choose and earn through progression. 

However there is a lot of unexplained bs I find myself experiencing the longer this game exists and I play it. I'm discovering I mostly experience this on a handful of last stand maps which include Ichiban, Winter Is Coming, Wind Tunnel, and Gator Valley. Ichiban seems to suffer from irregular and varied windows in which the player will be instantly knocked out from a punch or item used by another player. Not to mention it feels I have significantly less time to jump back up out of the gas than others players do, even dying within a second after losing consciousness regardless if I did before I was thrown down there. Winter is Coming is one of the most bs levels I've played given it seems I freeze a lot quicker than others players do at the end game while they can get up instantly or roll back without ever freezing at the end way too often to not be noticed. I see this happen on variety of other levels as well mentioned above at times including a handful of team levels. I don't know if that's due to anything in particular but it's becoming more apparent the longer I own this game. 

Because of that alone, I find myself playing this game less and less due to the bs luck people get in general. As mentioned, they are able to wake from knockouts, get back onto ledges, or even roll back into play before timeouts on various levels way quicker than I can. I don't want to hear the ""lack of skill"" and that kinda crap. I've played this game during Beta over 20 hours including the version from a couple years ago. It wasn't this bad at the start but you notice it more obviously the longer you play, whether a session or playing the game for a number of weeks. I'm seeing a game become less fair in non team games the longer I play this game. Sadly that means it's becoming a crappier product unless it's 4v4 a lot of the time to balance out the unexplained bs.

Would I recommend the games? Yes.

148801012,english,"This game deserves every negative review it gets and more, there is not a single skillful thing about this game. You can knock yourself out by landing on your ass, they've completely gutted headbutting and hit accuracy in general. You are more often punished for playing aggressively / trying to defend yourself than you are rewarded, between knocking yourself out constantly with headbutt, which USED to be a valid offensive strategy 3 years ago, and matches where people will  gang up on you whether they're on the same team or not, you are never fully in control. This game at its core is a ""party game"" but every single element besides its randomness (in my opinion, inconsistency is a better word) sets it up to be as competitive as possible, and the majority of the community acts and treats it like this.

Input delay on both KB/M and controller is incredibly noticeable. (This wasn't a thing 3 years ago during very early alpha playtests). It's something I thought would be an issue only at launch but it appears to be here to stay for good and is really one of the main reasons for this negative review. All of my data, controller inputs included, must be sent and reviewed by China before being allowed to be used in game I suppose. Picking a region of play where I have low ping makes no difference and this input delay is even noticeable in the tutorial which shouldn't involve an internet connection at all yet I still have input delay that makes having any sort of reaction time useless. I would compare this delay to having a ping of well over 200ms at all times. I am constantly playing with/against people who are not in my region which is simply obvious based on their usernames and the languages they speak, which can range anywhere from Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Russian and French, which makes me wonder if choosing a region for matchmaking is even a thing or just a placebo.

Most of the last stand maps are sub-par at best, with some of them like Typhoon being a complete waste of everyone's time by its map design and mechanics alone. The sports team game-modes are very boring and are also a massive waste of time, and when they end in draws (which is common because the scores required to ""win"" these matches are higher than they need to be so they drag on forever) no one wins anything which just further cements time wasted.

The ability to throw objects at players when you're eliminated is possibly the worst game feature they've added since the alpha 3 years ago. In most cases when you have been eliminated you can easily decide the fate of one if not multiple players with this absolutely brain-dead, easy to use system. This mechanic also further promotes playing passively as the more people you knock out the more people you have throwing things at you and angry at you next round. It takes no skill, does not feel rewarding, and is absolutely rage inducing to be on the receiving end. In rare cases your reticle for aim is completely inaccurate and things you're throwing will go no where near where you are aiming. It is not a function of the ""random party game"" elements they have in place but rather it is consistently awful in certain scenarios where it just wasn't tested or the devs just don't care. There should be a queue for players who don't want this mechanic so the game can have at least some semblance of reward for being skilled instead of punishing you for playing well.

There is a 2 min quick match ban for leaving any match for any reason, even if your own teammate is greifing you because they're part of a 3-queue in a 2v2v2v2 game mode. There are people constantly cross-teaming to try and complete the achievements (most of which by their design encourage cross-teaming) that were made by idiots who in no way have ever actually even played the game before.

Speaking of a 2 min ban and why it's relevant, teammates are constantly AFK, and in pretty much every game mode this cements your loss. There is an AFK detection system that will kick these people, but it's easily bypassed by just pressing a button on your controller every once in a while. I guess these people want EXP while doing other things but when you lose you hardly get rewarded at all so they're literally just wasting other peoples time. You can report these people and they will not be banned, I have seen them weeks after meeting them initially doing the exact same thing as before. The bots that will replace your teammate if they do get kicked are completely useless (especially in sports game-mode, they will just walk off in random directions and run into walls) and sometimes even a hindrance, but by the time they're added in the damage is already done and you've lost anyways.

The loot box system in this game has duplicates, which you will roll plenty of, a low roll chance for ""legendary"" skins all of which look average compared to things that you can buy from the cosmetics store (most of which cost nemo bucks, or in rare cases just straight up dollars/euros) in the cosmetics store, and nemo bucks themselves are a finite resource that when you run out of you have no recourse other than paying real money if you didn't get the skin you want.

This doesn't even consider the absolutely scummy, extremely toxic and racist community. Text and especially Voice Chat between players is nothing but a negative experience as like I said earlier, everyone treats this game like its competitive, similar to shooters like CS:GO. People getting by with names that blatantly have an uncensored racist words in them and much more. The censorship for chat in this game is also hilarious, censoring words like ""dumb"" and ""server"". I have seen words that I will not repeat here that are not censored and definitely should be.

Also not even touching on the local co-op fiasco the game had when it first launched as it doesn't effect me, but really? ""English isn't our native language"" isn't an excuse for promising something and then delivering the opposite, you can't possibly tell me you don't have the funds to hire a decent translator or someone with an actual head above their shoulders that can go ""i see you guys are saying you have local co-op, but it's no where to be found so are you sure that's what you meant?"". It all just leaves a bad taste and screams incompetency. 

1 month after the game has released and there is nothing new and certainly nothing to look forward to. The cosmetic shops rotate the same cosmetics in the exact same order, all of the changes they've made via updates have had little to no impact on the game other than adding in 4v4s in last stand for 4 queues which i've heard a lot of people don't even like. 

The gameplay when you ignore all of these issues I've mentioned has become stale and repetitive, combined with the occasional AFK or cross-teamers this game just doesn't have good longevity and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The only reason I even bought this game is because the product it was 3 years ago was very promising, and what the game currently is is now is a shadow of what could have been a good game.",1698171003,1698171003,FALSE,3,0,0.4554744660854339,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198113971697,134,7,2876,0,2763,1698807029

148653804,english,"I can only recommend this game if you're blessed by RNGesus. Prepare yourself for spam based gameplay, the most obnoxious spectators in any game period, zero inkling of skill required to win, tedious achievements that borderline require brain dead opponents and a full coordinated team, unbalanced gameplay dictated by a dice roll of where things drop and how maps behave, and mashing for hours just so you can control your character for 2 milliseconds before getting knocked out by a single attack. 

Frankly I don't know how to fix everything due to most interactions being based on the physics engine, but a cooldown on being knocked out would be a fantastic start. Heavy punches should slow the character down to avoid the spamminess of people just sniffing your bum until you're KOed since you can't take the time to turn around without getting KOed, you can't sprint away since heavy punches not only don't slow you down, but actually speed the character up, and rolling in any direction can be countered by following with a roll or standing still to catch a backwards roll. Mashing to wake up should be replaced with a timer that starts when you please (since playing dead is a ""mechanic"") or a quick minigame, and you should know exactly how long you'll be knocked out for. Nunchuks need to have a higher probability of knocking yourself out, or be less consistent in KOing opponents. There's also an overall lack of consistency in landing blows, sometimes people will launch without getting KOed, other times you'll land 27 heavy punches or dropkicks (which are supposed to be an immediate KO) and you'll just bounce off every time like your opponent is a brick wall.

I want to love this game, and it's a ton of fun when it's fun, but it's very quickly becoming tedious to even play due to how easy it is to get get spammed to death all within seconds of the round starting. Oh also the soccer field is way too big and it turns into a rolling simulator.

148578155,english,"All around, it's a great game with pretty decent replayability and brings out a bunch of laughs. Unfortunately, it seems like the devs really just do not care about the community's interests. Local Play is a mediocre experience with huge frame drops when using split screen (split screen already being a HUGE disappointment), the obvious predatory features like loot boxes/gacha/insane in-game currency prices in general, and there's no visible road-map provided on any of the game's social media pages; there really hasn't been any notable updates, besides minor bug fixes, within the month that it has been out. This game has a potential to be REALLY great considering it has such a vibrant artstyle and well-constructed maps, but it can be SO much better if the devs can manage to unplug their ears to hear the community.

Future Edit: The Party Animals website now links a forum where you can both ask questions, show your concerns, and even connect with developers through a ""Q and A"" format periodically.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

It's a hilarious game.  Just simply fun to play at the right moments.  Matches don't take long to find.  A lot of different skins and animals to chose from, and while there is an in-game store, it's not hard to get in-game currency to buy what you want.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Some maps take forever to finish, like the soccer or football ones.  They aren't too fun after awhile.

Some maps are just bad entirely, so they are rarely picked.  Don't know how many total maps there are, but four or five are just never picked, so I've only experienced them a handful of times.

It's impossible to tell what is cheating and what is legit.  Some characters can move before timer counts down, seems to have longer life in places where other characters don't, etc.  The devs seem to lack communication in this area.  What has been implied is that some characters can be better than others - which is poor design.

The weekly quests are just bad.  Have to do one specific thing usually on a few specific maps.  It's frustrating and not fun.  They need to be more generalized, or randomized, so not everyone has to do the same thing.

Skin rotation is poor.  I've been waiting weeks for a skin to return.

Disconnects are more common in the middle of matches.  It's getting worse by the week.

Also, constant Twitch events instead of actually trying to improve the game.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

For now, keeping it installed when I want something a bit more lighthearted to play.  Hope they add more maps or change up existing ones to get more variety.  But I am seeing more flaws each week I play, so I am sure it's on life support with me at this point.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!",1697832615,1703628926,FALSE,0,0,0.4761904776096343,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198003174259,1727,317,3712,146,925,1707106733
148561102,english,"You ever had a dream where you're trying to punch or push something, but you don't really have any force behind it so you just kind of end up swinging your arm casually over in their general direction? Or you try to say something, but you can't really make any noise, you just sort of whisper?

This game is like that. With everything. The punching, the climbing, the running and jumping, even the shooting. It's like you're in a dream where no matter what you try to do, you won't be able to do it. Like your muscles are made of microwaved playdough, you have motor control dysfunction in all parts of your body except your center mass, and you have no depth perception. And whatever you plan to do, will execute either miserably late, or at best, hilariously wrong, both of which, together, start to get real frustrating after only a few hours.

So if you're looking for the closest thing the video game industry has to the muppets drunken boxing each other, while the people under the table controlling the muppets are also drunk, look no further. Because the only way I can see this game being enjoyable is while being completely, utterly blasted. With friends. And at that point, any game that has online multiplayer will do, so it's not intended as praise. 

Save your money. Buy another bottle of whatever you were intending to drink to make this game fun in the first place, then drink it and play something else.",1697832257,1697832539,FALSE,2,1,0.4857142865657806,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198137484299,0,1,346,0,346,1697829461

148525930,english,"It has been a crazy ride! After all and all, I finally aced the achievements! I always wait for full achievements to make a review, this one has just been one of the tougher ones, if not the toughest! 

I really admire this game in most of the aspects. You don't often get a game that is this replay-able, this carefully designed and this well-executed. As a party game it has the right vibe --- the competitive aspect works just fine, not too much nor too light. On the other hand, the physics in the game hits different --- It may look just like some other games which I won't name, but you have to play it to know how different they are. Not to mention the cute visuals --- Probably is what attracts people in the first place! 

While the game is casual, the achievements are quite challenging. As much as I struggled with some of them, I have to say they are well designed. They provide a sufficient amount of challenges, and in the mean time fun to attempt and does not ruin the game for you teammates (for the most part, some of them does require you to be a little selfish).

There has been many controversies around the game. The price does prevent a significant amount of my friends from joining me. The devs may not have taken the right response in many occasions. However, rarely do I see a hateful comment on the game itself: almost everyone agrees this game is great to begin with. Some may think overpriced, some may hate the micro-transactions, but that does not hinder its outstanding gameplay!

Overall I would recommend this to my friends (which I already did), but also to any of you who stump upon this review.

The controls work only after you figure out exactly how they work, (no thanks to the tutorial), because of how it's designed. To throw a person, it's not just grab them and face a direction and press x (or whatever on a KB and Mouse), you have to anticipate the momentum the person and yourself have and then sort of slingshot them in the direction you want.

Now with that in mind, you have people spending their entire days and nights figuring out how to micro-manage these tiny details so they can do a combination of button presses to fly across the level to knock you out within 5 seconds of the round starting and toss you 15 meters into the nearest pit because they're just learned how to be [i] that guy [/i] in a game designed like this.

Again, has an amazing potential, has been a lot of fun with friends, but it saddens me that every time we play it always ends with frustration because of one guy in the lobby who's spent an abnormal amount of hours in this game eliminates us all within seconds and abuses niche mechanics that aren't taught to players in the tutorial.

One final thought that's been apparent to me is that the game offers very little to no feedback to the player during playtime. You'll only ever know if you knocked another person out or if they knocked you out and if you're dead. 
This causes so much frustration because half the time you don't know if you're doing anything my swinging at another player and you feel as though the game begins implementing an RNG element here you have a 50/50 chance to knock someone out on a hit. Idk, maybe a skill issue, but some more feedback regarding play actions would be sooo incredibly appreciated.",1697708136,1697708222,FALSE,2,0,0.5473250746726989,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198051689737,281,4,274,0,230,1699702093

148335592,english,"2v2v2v2 IS STILL IN THE GAME

It was never removed, all the devs did was make it so groups of 3 or more can't play 2v2v2v2 because that would allow for an unfair advantage. My guess as to why these people are complaining are either because they wanted to ruin the fun of solo/duo players (with either teaming up against said players or just holding a match open for as long as possible) or they just want to hate this game.

as for my thoughts on the game, it's pretty good. I really like how floppy the animals are, the fighting doesn't require that much skill, and the different maps always bring something new to the fight, so it's not just ""punch animal and win"". I still have yet to decide on the monetisation in the game though.

The Item Shop presents a bunch of skins in 2 areas: Daily rotation, and Weekly rotation. The skins will either cost Cookies (which are earned through playing the game) and Nemo bucks (which you can buy, but can be earned through challenges and the levelling system (which is a ""battlepass"" but with no premium track)). You can also earn skins through a gacha system, using Egg tokens which are earned through the levelling system or just bought with Nemo bucks.

I would be lying if I said I wasn't mixed on it. On one hand, it's free-to-play monetisation in a paid game, which is incredibly greedy, but on the other hand, they give you the currencies without having to buy anything (although it's limited to the current ""pass""/level track, which doesn't have a timer, so who knows when that'll change). There's also no benefit to buying any skin, but I also sit in the camp that hates the saying ""it's just cosmetics, they give no advantage"", especially in a game where there is no progression outside of the levelling, so cosmetics are the only thing we have.

If the devs are so dead set on having this monetisation though, I do think there should be one more compromise, one that will at least reduce the hatred for the gacha system and the game as a whole. Allow us to use our cookies to buy Egg tokens, even if it's a high price. The gacha is set up to guarantee a legendary every 70 rolls (as in you will get a legendary at 70, not one of those false one's where they say you should get it at 70) and an Epic at 10 rolls. This is incredibly greedy with the current system, but if we can use cookies to get Egg tokens, it will at least give us the satisfaction of having earned the legendary rather than feeling like we're gambling away our money.

TLDR: If you don't care for skins and you're looking for a party game to play with a group of friends, I recommend it, but if you hate greedy monetisation so much that you can't stand to even play a game that has it, don't bother.

I'll update this review later, when I've done more stuff in the game and more has been added. I mostly threw this together to push against the idea that 2v2v2v2 was gone, and the rest of it is just stuff I thought should be mentioned for anyone who's considering buying it.",1697464953,1697464953,TRUE,3,0,0.521739125,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198292082377,1085,22,696,0,302,1699581141
148332769,english,"Party Animals is a physics-based multiplayer brawler that has been eagerly anticipated by many gamers. However, the game's launch has been met with disappointment, as it is plagued by a number of issues, including:

Server problems: Players have been reporting frequent server disconnections and difficulty finding matches.
Lack of offline mode: This is a major oversight for a party game, as it means that players cannot play with friends without an internet connection.
Microtransactions: The game features a number of microtransactions for cosmetic items, which are expensive and feel predatory, especially for a game that is still in early access.
Lack of content: The game currently has a limited number of maps and game modes, which can lead to the gameplay becoming repetitive quickly.
In addition to these issues, the game also suffers from a number of performance problems, such as frame drops and stuttering.

Overall, Party Animals is a game with a lot of potential, but it is currently in a very rough state.

when you throw the fish or moon pies its not accurate as it should be and even though you hit direct hits a lot of times it does nothing.
it's fun, would be much better if they fixed the grip and accuracy.

148242512,english,"The game was good on release. But when the 1.1.1.0 update came out, there was hit box issues and climbing issues. It's almost as if the game took a step back into the beta. Kinda sad. It was good and now it's really not fun. You can't really overlook it either to enjoy the game. The issues take control of the fun now.

Hit-Boxes (MAJOR)- Sometimes it feels as if certain characters can hit harder than others and some characters can just tank hits. I knocked out a Gorilla with a hard punch and it only made him just fall over. But when he hits me I get thrown across the map and the punch would barely touch me. Sometimes hits don't even connect and it gets frustrating.

Climbing-Sometimes when you are about to die and try to climb, your character will just not climb or jump a millimeter in length and it's so frustrating. You have to let go and risk the chance of dying to try and climb again but it's not definite that it won't bug out.

NOTE-The release for the game had none of these issues. It was a lot of fun. Nothing in the patch notes had anything to do with touching these elements but it didn't matter. They added the fish back but what does that have to do with the elements of gameplay? The fish destroyed the game?

148185832,english,"Game is fun but I am noticing some inconsistencies after the latest update.  These various occurrences have made the game less enjoyable and make is seem as though it lacks balance.

I have had several punches and flying kicks land but the person I hit absorbs the blow and keeps moving like nothing happened.  This is also true when using weapons against other players.  They eat the weapon shot, and keep moving like nothing had happened.  Yet on the other hand, I've been knocked out by a punch mid roll away from said player, and I've even witnessed players being knocked unconscious when someone with a weapon was not even swinging.

The second thing that seems to be very inconsistent if the amount of time people are unconscious for.  Whether it is a kick, weapon, or punch, I have watched some players recover much faster than others which makes me question what the actual game design around these actions are.  Is it certain moves leave you KO'd longer or is it just RNG on how long you're out for.  I hit someone with a flying kick, and they were not even out long enough for me to grab them, yet they stand up, punch me, and I'm out long enough for them to throw me twice after failing the first.  

Lastly, on certain maps, some players seem to survive longer than others in deadly conditions, such as poison, and frost.  I've been tossed in as the game just starts and instantly died.  Other times I've watched players get knocked out into the deadly conditions, sleep it off, get knocked out again, sleep it off again, then climb/run right back into the fight.  How is that balanced?  

All of this seems to be more prevalent after the latest update, and has made the game less enjoyable to play because it makes you feel like the cards are stacked against you sometimes.  

Honestly, some changes I think would benefit everyone are a KO timer, a visible health bar so you know when you can and can't take certain fights, and then making some of these maps more like Broken Arrow where if you get thrown off, you're out.  Allowing some players to climb back into the fight and not others seems unfair and unbalanced.",1697270545,1697270545,FALSE,2,1,0.4731590151786804,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198161958722,167,4,5760,0,4195,1703831682

Many people don’t like it because you have to have internet to play and cannot play without. I do not think this is a problem at all since all you have to do is just make a private lobby and you can play with family and friends and almost everybody has internet. Also people say that their are micro transactions but this is not true at all because all of the currency can be earned totally free with the free battle-pass-like reward system. Another problem people don’t like about it is that when their are two players it is split screen.  My honest review is that people shouldn’t have such high expectations for game that just barely released and shouldn’t be rating this game a bad review because this game is still in an early stage.

EDIT: So, it turns out that I am very silly and don't pay attention. I have now played over 8 hours of the game and I'm loving it.
There are some annoying parts where it feels like the game is being unfair, and the ""dead player throwing"" system needs some work. When throwing things, there is nearly zero percent chance that you will hit someone with something you have thrown. The bombs also take over 5 seconds to explode, which is enough time for even someone that is unconscious to wake up and move.

148117621,english,"I'm going to go against the grain on this one and say I'm not really having fun at all. I wish I had refunded. This could be cute with a bunch of friends, but my experience is mostly solo or duo quick match. 

Not a fan of map voting for only one game being played. Why aren't there multiple game mode rounds with the same people on varying maps? Most of my matches people pick the same favorites and there's some maps I haven't gotten a chance to try. 

Too many teammates afking or deliberately trolling matches. I get that it's a chaotic game and you're going to accidentally punch someone here or there, but I can tell when a teammate continues to hunt you down and throw you off the edge it's intentional. If you dare leave you're the one getting punished with a que ban, really? Being held hostage in bad matches isn't fun.  

The controls aren't for me, they feel frustrating half the time. l2p issue, get good etc I know. Nothing feels worse than getting kicked at the start of the match when you've barely loaded in and you can't even recover before being eliminated before you got to play. 

Minor gripe: I don't know why a minute of character select is necessary for such a short game. People scrolling through their skins without picking until the timer runs out. Just pre-select what you want to play as and move on. Feels like I spend more time waiting on load screens than actual action. 

It's disappointing because I was hoping for something cute and lighthearted in the same realm of what Fall Guys felt like. The animals, game modes, and humor is there, but core game play isn't enjoyable for me.

- Cryo and Taser should NOT spawn on Broken Arrow because it can easily make one team win the whole round/game
- The projectiles thrown when you are dead rarely go where your cursor is pointed. I have hit several teammates because of this and have been accused of throwing
- Grabbing works 40% of the time when trying to climb up ledges, especially on Icebreak where it feels like only 10% of the time
- No indication if a game is going to be 2 or 4 teams during map select
- I have randomly been killed by teammates on maps like Typhoon who hit me once with a shovel accidentally and I die on the spot, not even being launched off of the submarine
- People were abusing a bug on turbine to survive while underneath the platform
- Hit detection can sometimes be like butter where you will just fly over someone. You'll just fly past them into the oblivion
- Having achievements be earnable by purchasing in game currency. Yes you don't HAVE to but the fact you can is disgusting.
- Other achievements are broken. I've won achievements for for the 4 team scenarios when I am in a 2 team game
- Beastball only has 11 rounds because some players will just instantly score a touchdown
- Turn off voice chat before you play casual. It's horrendous. I have been called every racial slur in the book by people who will use the gorilla character to roleplay as racial caricatures of black people.

The game itself is gorgeous, the mechanics are simple enough to give you room to experiment your ways to knock people out, either with your own hands or weapons.

Maps are varied and fun, especially the new ones.

Now, if you're planning to try quick play, be wary of trash talkers, they don't have a good life to be having fun here, so they use their superiority complex to achieve nothing.

But if you play online it's very frustrating. The fight mechanics are very hit and miss and often very random, and it becomes rather annoying that the 'dead' players can hit you with stuff after they've died. If you are the best at fighting, you still lose often because the dead players kill you by throwing objects.

The real downside of the game is the maps, or the lack of. First of all, they are not well thought out, and the maps that are not just fighting are so pointless. They are all about trying to carry things, and not fun at all. You can tell because they never get voted for.  

So at the end of the day, there's nothing but fighting to this game, and that gets old because of the lack of variety with the maps.

The combat is horrible, coming from gang beasts I cannot stand this combat and since combat still part of the fun game modes, the game modes take a hit.

147971009,english,"Woof woof! Oh boy, oh boy! I gotta tell you about this game I've been playin' with my pals lately. It's called Party Animals, and let me tell ya, it's a real tail-waggin' good time!

First things first, Party Animals is all about fun and silliness. It's like a big, virtual playdate for humans. You and your buddies can join in and have a howlin' blast together. Whether you're barkin' up a storm in a wrestling ring, racin' through wild obstacle courses, or just goofin' around, there's never a dull moment.

The best part is that it's super easy to pick up, even for a pup like me. The controls are simple, so even if you're not a pro gamer, you can jump right in and start chasin', grabbin', and tossin' stuff around. It's perfect for playin' with your friends, whether they're seasoned gamers or newbies.

The graphics are colorful and cartoony, just like a Saturday morning cartoon. The characters are a bunch of cuddly critters, and you can dress 'em up however you like. I mean, who wouldn't wanna see a cute dog like me dukin' it out with a stylish kitty or a dapper bunny? It's a fashionista's dream come true!

One thing I gotta mention is the laughter. Oh boy, the laughs are non-stop! The wacky physics and unexpected mishaps will have you rollin' on the floor laughin'. It's like a virtual comedy show where you and your friends are the stars.

And don't even get me started on the party modes! You can team up, go head-to-head, or just free-for-all. It's like a never-ending dog park full of surprises.

So, if you're lookin' for a pawsitively good time with your pals, Party Animals is the game to fetch. It's a riot of giggles and guffaws, and you'll be waggin' your tail with joy from start to finish. Just remember to have some tasty treats on hand for a post-game celebration.

147909584,english,"First off, the animals in this game are so incredibly adorable, the face they make when they are knocked out is just soooo cute.

The controls are awkward and delayed on purpose, this is to make it so that players of all skill level can enjoy this party game, you learn to pick things up and efficiently throw after a while, but it is still mostly luck. I'd say 30% skill. 70% luck. The overall clunkyness can lead to some pretty funny situations, definitely more fun to have the controls this way than to have it precise.

There are micro transactions in this game, but they are for cosmetics only, if you care about having the rarest/limited edition skins, you can sink a lot of money into it. The skins are aesthetics only, they do NOT give any advantages whatsoever or change the hit box of the characters. You can get in game currency, (both paid and non-paid) as you level up, and use it to unlock new outfits/characters. This is the only use for currency in this game.

I been playing for only 9 hours and never spent a single penny and already unlocked a lot of uncommon/rare skins just by leveling up and using the in game currency awarded to me for free.

147893641,english,"patch 1.1 made the game worse.

Unable to play the 2v2v2v2 maps as 2v2v2v2 and instead it's all 4v4. Which sure would be fine if you were as 4, but playing as a duo and getting teammates that find trolling is the most fun thing to do just ruins the experience.

Now the main reason for not recommending the game. The devs showed even more that the game is nothing more than a cashgrab. daily/weekly rotation shop is still a mix of in game earned currency and premium currency, the only store being rotation means you'll get FOMO for skins and if you want to try to get a specific skin you want you'll have to gacha with premium currency. Granted you can earn some by playing the game but it caps out at a relative lowly number, at lvl 54-55 I dont think I got more than 2.2-2.5k with a lot of achievements that earned them too and a legendary skin is over 3000 premium currency in the rotation shop. Now they decided to speed up the milking of the playerbase by releasing a skin that is only available from direct purchase which clearly shows they just want some money fast and dont care about the game having any form of longitivity. 

So in all reality I can only say, the game is not worth the 18$ price tag, it isnt even worth a 5$ price tag in its current state. If they want to insist on a premium currency in the store that they force FOMO on and include lootboxes they should make the game f2p. if they want to keep the price tag put all skins in a shop for premium currency and have the rotation one solely use the cookies to buy skins from and the fucking gacha should NOT be premium and instead be cookies again.",1696800724,1696800724,FALSE,4,0,0.4853273034095764,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198250570304,125,2,3942,0,2177,1699753574

I've done cartwheels midair, get flung out of the map at terminal velocity, drop kick people, and dodge frying pans. The maps are great, but there are a need for a few more, and removing the ""winter is coming"" map. I also thought a better way to get Eggcoins, the currency in which you can spin for a random skin or 'style; for an animal. Also, it requires a good chunk of grinding to get cool rewards. Its also nice that they come out with (what I call the original style for the characters) a 'base skin', at least one, everyday in the shop, for a low-ish price of 900 cookies (can be more than that but that's what it usually is). The item shop resets at 11:00 for me, which is a super weird time in my opinion. Its weird how they chose the middle of the day when a lot of people are at work or school to change the shop, making them have to wait after whatever they're doing.Its (in my opinion) better than gang beasts, except for some of the controls. If you liked Gang Beasts, try this out, if you haven't tried gang beasts, try this game out. Its hilarious, except for some times I'm being serious and trying to get achievements.

i think they should re evaluate the ko system and make it to where there is no difference in the ko time unless its a sprint hit, weapon hit, or light punch. the way it is now it seems to be rng and it is so rage inducing it makes me not want to play. as previously stated how can i hit someone with a sprint hit and they get up in 5 seconds but they do it to me and it takes me lik 20 seconds.

i also experience a problem with picking people up to throw them over an obsticle. maybe its just me? but it seems odd that when i first started playing i always could and now i cant. other than those two issues the game is fun, looks great, runs great. but its becoming more and more a chore to play a game i had a lot of fun with because those mentioned issues. i really hope it gets fix or i dont see my self playing it much anymore",1696734004,1696734004,FALSE,0,0,0.4670329689979553,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561199117656239,0,1,9085,967,2217,1707105750

I know others have complained about its only online nature. I feel like thats the majority of multiplayer games anymore. Its kind of a given anymore. 

One review complained about the toxic community and the lobbies being COD like. I have not really experienced this at all. Maybe once. I know Ive only had one lobby ever that everyone used mics. You can turn off comms. You can make it just your party/team if needed or even off. Its easily alleviated. 

The weapons can be OP from time to time. But other than that, the quirky combat is perfect and fun. I enjoy the weirdness of it all and laughing no matter what happens.

Luckly people (not me included) have the divine's blessing and get to join through discord without any issue, but lost children (like me) have to cry in the corner and have to beg the host to turn off the locked room for just a moment. I never felt this much of a begger than in this game. Secondly, the controls? Like how many times does this game need to know that I want to grab that damn weapon? I'm already menacingly standing above the weapon, having only the grip in my mind, but what does the game do? Bro, I'll grab that rock for you. I beg your pardon, game? I have never felt this rage in my body, just wanting to grab on this damn shovel. BRO I JUST WANTED THAT SHOVEL. Anyway, let's all calm down first. Okay, so I get the idea about the fun being squishy thing like in Gang Beast, but I'm not a fan of a squishy thing that trips over its own feet.

147801366,english,"Overall, it's a very good game and a fuck ton of fun when playing with friends. I reluctantly have to give it a negative review however due to its current issues such as,

- No oceanic servers and etc servers which means having to play in servers nowhere close resulting in 200+ ping games making it extremely hard to play with the games relaxed/floaty physics. (srsly its 2023 how are developers forgetting that a large majority live in these places :/ )

- aggressive f2p elements in a paid game like for instance,     xp being capped after a certain amount of games in private matches (why???) and stingy currency drops.

- microtransactions. (everyone has already talked about this to death so I'll refrain although all of the complaints are justified even if you arent participating in purchasing them) 

This game will most likely follow in the same footsteps as fall guys and go f2p (wouldn't be surprised considering this game is already set up like one) way later on once the player numbers dwindle like most live service fads.

If you don't want to read the whole pros-cons list / essay, skip to the summary at the bottom.

[h2]Pros:[/h2]
- Easy to find a game, never had to wait more than 2 minutes at any time.

- Super fun with friends, it's a better, bigger version of gang beasts. 

- Good variety of maps. modes & weapons to make things interesting.

- Characters are cute and charming, the IP colabs are really well done. 

- Lots of replay-ability, this has become my groups ""go-to"" game for the past week.

- Matches are quick and easy to drop in & out.

- Overall great party game.

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
- No OCE/Aus or South America server, this makes the game very difficult to play with a ping of 160+ at least. If you're in this region you'll often find yourself starting match knocked out and all the other cons that come with playing on 180 ping.

- If you have a party of 3 we've found that it likes to consistently pair the same people up no matter who the party leader is or join order, it often leaves that third person the odd one out.

- Without frequent updates adding new maps, modes & weapons this game will probably not have much longevity, after 19 hours the magic is slowly starting to wear off.

- [b]Monetisation,[/b] don't really need to explain much more on this but after spending $30 on the game finding out skins you want are locked behind the combo of a store & mystery crates (in the form of eggs), leaves a little bit of a sour taste in your mouth, feels a lot like it's going to be made free-to-play at some stage.

- Overall toxicity, there's little censorship in the game, people can name themselves a variety of slurs without problem, but words like [i]Stinky[/i] & [i]Slayer[/i] are censored?

- No offline play, huge issue for a lot of people and the way they addressed it seemed quite disingenuous.


[h1]Summary: [/h1] The game has the building blocks to set it up to be amazing, it unfortunately falls short at the moment but it's nothing it can't fix.
The introduction of new servers, offline play, map & modes and removal of monetisation are all things that could be added or fixed in future updates.

[i]If[/i] you're someone who's on the fence about buying the game or your friends are trying to gaslight you into getting it even though you think you won't enjoy it, I'd say your best bet would be to wait a month or so and keep an eye on the updates & see if the reviews take an upturn. 

[i]If[/i] you have the disposable income, friends[i](optional)[/i] live somewhere there's a server & this won't stop you from buying another game this month, go for it. It's a super fun game best enjoyed with other people not focusing on being competitive I guarantee you'll have a good time.

🐾 Graphics & Animation: The visuals are just adorable. Every character model oozes charm and personality. The animations, from the clumsy falls to the ragdoll physics, add layers of comedy that make each match memorable.

🐾 Gameplay: Simple to pick up but with enough depth that keeps bringing you back. Whether you're tugging on a jelly bean in a frantic game of keep-away or trying to toss an opponent off a floating platform, there's never a dull moment.

🐾 Sound & Music: The sound effects are spot on. Every thud, whack, and squeak adds to the hilarity. The background music is catchy and fits the theme of cute chaos perfectly.

🐾 Community: What's better than playing with friends and howling in laughter together? The community is great, and with frequent updates and new content, there's always a reason to jump back in.

Minor Gripes: While the game is incredibly fun, occasionally there can be connection issues or glitches. But the developers seem active and responsive, often addressing issues in updates.

Final Thoughts: If you're looking for a game that offers non-stop laughter, especially in group play, ""Party Animals"" is a must-have. It's a perfect blend of chaos, strategy, and hilarity, wrapped in an irresistibly cute package. Grab your friends, pick your fuzzy fighter, and let the adorable anarchy begin.",1696644002,1696644002,TRUE,0,0,0.4910714328289031,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561199205828133,0,37,1274,0,422,1703035649

Pros:
 - Extremely well performing on my 3060ti & Ryzen 3700X on ultra settings.
 - AMD FSR and NVIDIA DLSS Support
 - NVIDIA Reflex support 
 - This game is actually mega fun
 - Great Character design
 - The game will give you free currency just for playing the free battle-pass. Whatever caused the negative reviews is now irrelevant.
 - No pay to win
 - Apparently there's online only mechanics behind the game, honestly, this doesn't bother me. I'm not interested in playing single player.

Cons
 - Doesn't support steam game invites
 - There are some cases where you'll die from melee impact of weapons, not sure what this is or why but it can be annoying (no HP bar?)
 - Game doesn't tell you what to press to get back up after a knockout. Should be a recovery bar or something",1696643907,1696643907,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198006573130,190,3,960,0,206,1697664178

147756255,english,"After just buying a new PC with what I'd consider to be pretty good specs (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050, AMD Ryzen 5 5600 6-Core Processor and 16GB of RAM), I fully expected this game to run at no less than 60 FPS, which wasn't the case at all. After around 30 minutes of consistent gameplay, the FPS dropped so slow (around a 5-10 FPS mark) to the extent that it became unplayable. Another few noteworthy inconsistencies would be the gameplay mechanics altogether, i.e punching, grabbing, throwing. Everything just seems so tedious and luck based to the point where it doesn't feel rewarding at all when you win games, it's almost as if the only way to successfully execute an intended action is to pray to the luck gods that your character decides to align properly to the exact correct molecule. It's like controlling a boneless corpse. Not to mention the weapon spawns too. Why is it fair that one player with a shovel or nun-chucks can knock other players out in seconds? That way the game just becomes a race to get a weapon and practically become unstoppable. I recall being able to keep a player knocked out on the ground almost permanently by just spamming the headbutt control, rendering them useless for the majority of the match. One unintended press of a button and it could be the reason for a loss. Keeping in mind the target audience for this game is likely younger children, I can imagine that it's perhaps unfair to judge a family type party game on control consistency, but it's no secret that older audiences play this game too. Not to mention that this game costs actual MONEY with very minimal maps and game modes to play on as well as an army's worth of in-game purchases that can be made for a pretty excessive price in my opinion. This game is in NO way worth it's price, nor is it worth playing alone (or on a decent PC for some reason?). There is an extensive amount of teamwork based modes in this game too, which I found to be unpleasant when being paired with literal children that had absolutely no idea what they were doing, making winning almost impossible when almost every single match I participated in, I HAD to have a teammate.

147654054,english,"This game is getting a ton of hate over the gacha mechanics and because there are micro transactions. For one, you DO NOT need to spend any real life money to acquire any skins in the game whatsoever. The in-game currency is attainable through just leveling up and playing the game. There has only been one skin that was locked behind a paywall, which was because it was a collaboration with some other company. I have played for 50 hours now, and have only spent 5 bucks for that one skin, but I have gathered dozens of other customization's through just playing the game. I find it ridiculous how people like to bash this game for it's micro transactions when nobody is forced to pay for it, if they had just played the game they would've had their desired skin in like an hour. Also keep in mind this game is $30 dollars, there are companies that actually make you pay $70 dollars and still expect you to pay for a battle pass and other skins, while this game offers everything for free. 

A real critique that I can offer about the game is that it's maps sort of pale in comparison to gang beast's and that maps that are mainly fighting and throwing each other aren't the main focus, but rather more sort these little mini games and team competitions. Another critique I'd give this game is that there isn't much else to do after hitting the max level, I personally haven't hit the max level as of yet, however I do hear about there being a lack of content after reaching level 100. The biggest thing that probably bothers me about this game is that there are some skins locked behind doing stuff on other apps, for example there was a T-pain skin that you could only get from I believe tuning into the guy's stream. No offense but I aint tryna watch his ahh. There was also a tiktok skin, and other's, that seems like such a chore to do for a skin. 

What this game does well is just laughing at every game. In a typical game you can just expect to be beaten and tossed around, watch a bunny beat a gorilla to death in some corner, and a bear drop-kicking some other animal. This game's funky physics, movement, and implementation of weapons and stage hazards, offer a good balance of competition and party craziness. Also as I said, the fact that everything is attainable through just playing the game is a big plus, the closest thing I can compare it to is when you would buy a skin pack in PVZ Garden Warfare 2 if that makes sense. 

The one thing that this game will always have my support over Gang Beasts is that it actually updates there game regularly with new cosmetics and even stages, unlike that dead game that hasn't been updated in over a year. But yeah, this game is fun, definitely needs work on there being grounded stages for just fighting and for there to be a bit more diversity other than just 2v2v2v2, but it's still young and has been making efforts to improve.",1696466694,1707113268,TRUE,4,0,0.5315024256706237,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198983920010,0,18,3002,774,3002,1707019455

I have to say this game is definitely worth $20 let alone if it ever goes on sale.

Pros:
-Fun movement mechanics that gives a new life to games similar to gang beasts and human fall flat.
-Variety of diffrent objectives/maps/outfits
-Easy to pickup for anyone (had lots of newbie friends play like pros after a few games)
-Custom games is surprisingly well fitted with options and maps/gamemodes 
-Good amount of achievements

Cons:
-No official offline support (note: this is a party game so it does not affect the majority of players)
-skins are a bit expensive along with the deceptive practice of 2 seperate curencies (not as bad as other games where you cant convert currencys)
-After playing 24 hours, maps are kinda dull (maybe add custom maps/gamemodes)

Overall take: Great party game for 2-8players, my friends and I pickup this game when were bored and have lots of enjoyable moments and fun memories. 

Ps. Free skin for getting 3 starts on tutorial.

Unfortunately after playing the game for a few hours and having the same minigames rotate in over and over with no diversity, as well as so many last man standing games where if you get knocked out quickly you sit and not play the game for 3 to 5 minutes, honestly I can say that you will spend more time not playing the game while in it then you will playing it.

I wanted this to be fun, I wishlisted it and got friends to get it, but in the end I wish I hadn't. Nobody wants to play a game where you get knocked out quickly and then dont play for several minutes while everyone else plays. Also if knocked out you cannot quit back to the menu to start another game, because you will get a BAN for doing so, even if you are already knocked out. You have no choice but to sit there not playing the game...

At least in games like World of tanks and such if you die, you can return to the garage and pick a different vehicle to play another round with. In this you sit and do nothing accept every 20-30 seconds you can throw a banana peel at the people actually playing.

Large waste of money and would refund if I hadn't played over the 2 hour limit trying to learn the minigames at the beginning... :/

Lots of character potential, but poorly thoughtout game modes. Maybe consider adding the option to either play last man standing modes, game modes where you dont die and stop playing, and then a random mode.

Then the player could actually play the game STYLE they wanted to play, similar to other games letting you choose random, elimination, or capture the flag.

It is also quite disappointing how the Storefront mindset, where the games serve more as a storefront for monetization than an actual game, rears its ugly head once again.

Why in the world would they otherwise have no direct way to start a Local Game (you have to use the Serverbrowser and set it to private to start a local game) and right at release sell Skins that cost nearly as much as the actual game?

My plan was to stick this on the Steam Deck and then take it to friends. 
Not going to happen. I am not going to be, from their perspective, weird and ask my friends for their Wifi password so I can connect my gaming thing to it. 

Real shame. 

And the way this released also kind off betrays either a real disconnect with gamers that'd go for a game like this or the fact they ultimately were geifering for primarely the money after the massive Wishlisting the game must have experienced when it was first announced and I believe after a Demo was available. 

Again, just a shame but by now we should probably be expecting disappointments like this.

Because of how many people have complained about it, I really hope they rectify this. I'm imagining that it isn't that hard to do and if this many people are giving bad reviews for this specific reason, then it means that this game is failing a very large portion of its audience in that regard.

Other than that, it's gangbeasts with more content. More maps, more modes and much higher quality assets. I love the cute designs but I just really want it to be playable because atm its hard not to constantly accidentally drop kick my friend in the face until his head is mash potatoes. The input delay due to the lag is wild, especially when contrasted with the client sided tutorial. Which also brings me to the issues of local co-op.

This delightful and whimsical game has captured the hearts of gamers worldwide with its unique gameplay mechanics, charming characters, and captivating visuals. With an emphasis on fun and laughter, Party Animals has proven itself to be an exquisite gaming experience that surpasses Gang Beasts in numerous aspects.

One of the defining features of Party Animals is its innovative and intuitive gameplay mechanics. Unlike Gang Beasts, which primarily relies on ragdoll physics, Party Animals presents players with a more refined and polished control system. The controls in Party Animals are responsive and easy to grasp, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the game without feeling hindered by clunky movements. The precision and fluidity of the controls add an extra layer of enjoyment, making every action feel deliberate and satisfying.

Moreover, Party Animals boasts a diverse and lovable cast of characters that are brimming with personality. From the mischievous raccoon to the adorable penguin, each character is distinct and offers a unique playstyle. This variety ensures that players can find a character that resonates with them, enhancing the overall experience. On the other hand, Gang Beasts lacks the same level of character diversity, which can lead to a sense of repetition and monotony in gameplay.

Furthermore, Party Animals' vibrant and visually stunning graphics elevate the game to new heights. The colorful and detailed environments, coupled with the charming character designs, create a visually appealing world that is a joy to explore. The attention to detail in Party Animals is remarkable, with even the smallest elements contributing to the overall aesthetic.

147545969,english,"Determining whether ""Party Animals"" is better than ""Gang Beasts"" or vice versa is subjective and depends on individual preferences. Both games fall under the same genre of physics-based multiplayer brawlers and offer unique experiences. Here are some reasons someone might prefer ""Party Animals"" over ""Gang Beasts"":

1. **Graphics and Art Style:** ""Party Animals"" features cute and colorful animal characters, which can be more appealing to those who prefer a lighthearted and family-friendly aesthetic. ""Gang Beasts,"" on the other hand, has a more intentionally quirky and ragdoll style.

2. **Gameplay Variety:** ""Party Animals"" may offer a broader range of gameplay modes and scenarios, catering to players who enjoy diverse challenges beyond just brawling. This can include mini-games, obstacle courses, and more.

3. **Controls:** Some players may find the controls in ""Party Animals"" to be more intuitive or responsive than those in ""Gang Beasts,"" depending on personal preferences.

4. **Online Multiplayer:** ""Party Animals"" might have improved online multiplayer features or netcode, making it a better choice for those who want to play with friends or others online.

5. **Development and Updates:** The ongoing development and support for ""Party Animals"" may provide players with more frequent updates, new content, and bug fixes, which can enhance the overall gaming experience.

6. **Community and Player Base:** Depending on the platform and region, one game may have a more active and engaged player community, leading to a better multiplayer experience.

However, it's important to note that ""Gang Beasts"" also has its own merits and a dedicated player base. Some players might prefer its more unique and quirky style, or they may have a nostalgic attachment to it since it was one of the earlier games in this genre.

Ultimately, which game is ""better"" depends on your personal preferences, the features you value most in a multiplayer brawler, and the kind of experience you are seeking.

I really really want to recommend this game, but the state it is in at this very moment I cannot. 

The concept is amazing, and I adore all the cute animals along with the cosmetics that are out, and the collabs they've done. Visually it is a really good, a cute cartoon-y game where you get to be a stuffed animal.

Unfortunately, the community is already incredibly toxic and the game hasn't even been out more than two weeks. I am a girl and I feel like I am in a COD lobby by the amount of hate I get when speaking. It is very common to get cussed out in games and called slurs because you knocked somebody out or are just playing that game the way it is meant to be played, OR because you sound like a girl. [spoiler] [i](If I get told to make one more sandwich I am going to put laxatives in it).[/i] ʘ‿ʘ [/spoiler] 

You would think with the game being about really cute stuffed animals the community would be nice and welcoming, but it's not. You can argue that I should just mute the voice chat or just ignore it, but the game was made with voice chat and I enjoy interacting with the wholesome section of this community, the ones that are just trying to have fun and don't threaten to un-alive you for knocking them out.

And the game play, I could write an entire review just about this. You can pick up a weapon, and it is pretty much game over for everyone else without a weapon unless the weapon holder is miraculously knocked out, or they run out of stamina. If you get nun-chucks or a shovel then it is almost impossible to get close enough to that person to knock them out, especially on maps like the alligator river or airplane, because those are not at all forgiving and one misjudged jump is the end. I think weapons should have some type of cool down or some type of durability at least. There should be no reason a single cat with a pair of nun-chucks can knock out eight people in a row and win the game simply because they were the first person to pick up a weapon. It is ridiculous.

Speaking of being knocked out, what is the point in playing when people can just stand over you and continuously knock you out? There have been many times where somebody is upset and targets me or another person and tries to keep them knocked out for the entirety of that game, and it is incredibly frustrating to stand up only to be drop kicked into the shadow realm once again. 

This is just a quality of life request really, but they should add something in the game where you can see your own stuffed animal better. This would help visually impaired individuals, because sometimes you can lose your own character in the chaos of everyone. Maybe a little glowing outline or something else to better indicate where you are in the group.

Overall, I like the concept of this game. It is cute and fun with friends, but it certainly can be improved. If you are looking to buy it I would wait a little while to see if there are any updates. 

[strike] [b] UPDATE 08 OCTOBER: [/b] So, they updated the game to make seemingly all of the games 4v4, which is ish IMO. They should add an option to have 2v2 modes AND 4v4 modes, that way duos and large groups have options to play together on the same team. I think the 4v4 isn't necessarily a bad thing, but having a wider range of team sizes that you can select from would be nice. [/strike]

[b] UPDATE 10 OCTOBER: [/b] They reverted back to the 2v2 modes thankfully

[b] UPDATE 23 NOVEMBER: [/b] Just updating this for the Steam Awards, (for the better with friends catergory) but I think that the changes the devs are implementing soon will definitely help the game.",1696303029,1700767844,FALSE,399,63,0.7379360795021057,60,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198269182961,91,5,3831,4,916,1707071509
147541069,english,"Since the first trailer of this game I was intrigued. To say the least, this game has been a blast since release. This is game is very fun when you play with friends, which I would recommend is getting a bunch of friends together and sitting down and playing online together either online or in a private match. Just a heads up that only parties of 4 will be allowed to que up online play. For everyone complaining about micro-transactions either you haven't played enough or just here to complain? They literally give you free cookies and nemo-bucks for leveling. I can see the loot boxing being a problem but either than that its cosmetics at the end of the day. I don't see a problem with micro-transactions if its not game enhancing.

At the end of the day it's a chill game where you can sit back relax and knock some people out and play as a team, nothing serious.

I'm not a Chinese player, but I too feel like shit when I wait for years for a good party game, and get a skin store with an optional game attached to it. It's quite clear what is really the focus here right after you launch the game. It wouldn't be a huge problem really unless it literally handicapped the game. Because it's an online gambling store first, they have to protect in-game currency and casino, that means they can't allow you to just gain experience and play locally. So ""local"" games will gain you exactly 1 XP out of thousands needed to unlock anything fancy, not to mention it just does not work offline if you'd like to play on a couch, so a lot of problems come from that - they have to reserve and pay for the data centers around the world, you have to deal with no unlocks from local games and ping issues. As for the game, I've expected a bit more polished Gang Beasts, but it's about the same if not less fun. Some game modes are good to try a couple of times, but there are not many. The visuals are good, sure, it's cute. But really, if that was a _game_ in the first place, it would have been released years ago, much more fun to play and just plain better.

The characters are adorable and plenty of cute in-game colours to unlock.

Yes there is a gacha system but you don't ever have to touch it, if you need to get a certain skin to enjoy the game, that is all on you they have plenty of animals for free/unlocked through in-game shop and even achievements to be happy with.

Only gripe is I wish costumes were not tied to certain colours, they should of been actual costumes and placed over any colour of said animal it was for.

Also play without VC because as always games like this just has alot of players who are toxic because winning a silly party game is their only achievement in life and will swear and throw racist slurs.

RAW RATINGS
Gameplay: 9/10
Performance: 8/10 - see addendum for more info
Visuals: 8/10
Sound: 7/10
Music: ?/10 (I play with music off)
UI: 9/10
Settings Options: 6/10
Pricing: 10/10
Cuteness: 20/10

DETAILS
Their is a surprising amount of strategic depth in even the simplest of choices, like whether to hold something single or multi-handed, drag someone single or mult-handed, when, what, who, and where to climb. You can even grab unto enemies OR friendlies, and make choices from there, possibly helping or hindering them.

There is the best selection of mini-games around, a whole mess of skins to earn including tie-in skins (Ori and The Blind Forest), the physics are sound and consistent, matches feel fair and balanced, death still allows minimal interaction (think rainbow six siege).

I would 1,000% recommend this game to anyone, no caveats.

--------------------

Addendum:
My PC houses a Ryzen 1600 and a RX580, 16GB ram, and an extremely fast storage. Despite my modest specs, I get a rock solid 75 if VSynced, and often significantly over if VSync is off.

The one exception to exceptional performance, which is the watery bridge map, which get atrocious FPS once waves start moving things around, most certainly CPU bottleneck here, as my GPU is relaxing with mimosas on a beach somewhere, whilst my CPU is in a coal mine in Africa working for warlords.

First off, the fact that you do not, and will not provide a local co-op after having it in your description for years is shameful amd should be investigated by steam for false advertising. The always online model does not work well when playing locally with multiple players, it's laggy and un-enjoyable, almost to the point of unplayable. And secondly, the Prices of in game skins are absolutely insane. $22 for 1 skin?? This game is just one big micro transaction. I see why you don't want people to play offline. There would be no way for them to purchase skins if they did, thus you won't offer it. 

One last note, the game is horribly unbalanced.

Some items are just completely broken and will eliminate players with the slightest touches (nun-chucks). Also, the kill feed options (log, banana, bomb), they are all super delayed when you click them and its again, another 50/50 shot, on whether the item you have chosen even lands on the map or gets flung off entirely.

147400450,english,"[h1] You pay to be spammed with microtransactions // Gacha lootboxes // Not-premium currency is indeed a hidden premium (p2f) currency[/h1]

This game was review bombed the first week due to the legendary skin price of $23 (50/50 the microtransaction mixed with the fact they promised offline which never came). Which is ridiculous considering is more expensive than the game itself and not even the deluxe edition would give you enough cash to buy that skin.

Then they """"""""""""""""heard"""""""""""""" the community and changed it to the in-game currency [b] BUT [/b] with a trick. Thing is that you can only farm these in-game currency via leveling the free pass (at least it is not worth another 15 bucks) which is tedious, and can only be actually raised by wins (loses actually do give some XP, but it's a misery tbh). Or by weekly quests, these quests only give you 1.500 coins each week (the same amount of time the shop takes to rotate). This means that the skins are """"""""obtainable without paying"""""""" but in reality, 22k coins (what they are priced at) costs, you guessed right, the exact same $23 than first week.

I'm only speaking of the rotative shop (which is another bad thing as well that this is a thing outside that trash game called Fortnite). Models are beautiful, but most skins can only be obtained via gacha, it is not that you can get them from lotboxes but they can appear in the shop, no, you can only obtain these by buying gacha lotboxes, most of them are the preferred by the community.

Don't get me wrong, the game itself is pretty fun. But don't make me waste money on a game where I'm spammed to ""progress"" to get skins but at the end the only way to get those skins is paying more than $20 each.

[h2] Having said that and mentioned the trash mix between fortnite/genshin impact monetize system, I have something to say about gameplay... [/h2]

I would recommend this game if it wasn't because of that trash monetization. It is pretty fun but still the game is not perfect. It is a copy paste of Gang Beasts but better, looks better, plays better, but here you can be knocked WAY too easy, only thing making it difficult is that the exagerated physics makes every hit fail randomly, but not big deal.

What's indeed a big deal is the fact that 80% of time you will be playing maps that you don't want to play on with people you don't want to play with because the main mode can only be played in random voted maps in teams, not deathmatch. This can be easily solved by a selector of preferred maps and team or solo check with a simple matchmaking auto-fill function in case it does not find anybody or enough players coinciding with you.

This is a problem considering that you're not probably going to like half of the maps on this game, since all the maps are not simple arenas but they all have ""handicaps"" you are going to probably be finding them tedious and stressful rather than fun. If you don't believe me, don't mute people, you will not take too much until someone appears yelling at how much they hate you and how much that map is trash.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]

🔹Just if they remove that monetization or somehow fix it, then I will change this review as positive, because the game is fun even with both negative gameplay aspects I mentioned. And I'm probably going to keep playing. 

🔹Just to be clear. I don't have any problem with cosmetics priced with real currency. My problem is when those skins are actually more expensive than an actual (irl) shirt (at least in my country, and I'm not even speaking of a low quality trash looking shirt). As a reference for another online-based games with microtransactions; I believe no game has right to charge a skin more than what League of Legends charges for theirs, unless it is half as popular as that game is. And skins there are not the cheapest, but at least they are way better than any other game's skins with all animations and proper visual and sound FX, definitively better than the overpriced cosmetics you will see here for $23.

🔹Until you see this review has been changed to positive, don't buy at full price; get it in a key website or wait until it is at least at 60% discount. 
Anyways, they will try to charge you over even breathing once you get in the game, then is when you notice this is a chinese developer.",1696125502,1696333360,FALSE,4,0,0.5296273827552795,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198357482524,0,7,2190,109,1992,1706316979

• Lots of variety in game modes to keep things fresh and a good map selection too.

• No offline mode is a bummer, especially when I just wanna play some lag-free split screen with the boys. I mean it barely lags but then when it does I don't wanna hear one of em use it as an excuse for losing lol.

• If I were playing this by myself only online I would definitely get bored and stop playing in like a month but because I'm playing locally with friends on the weekend I don't see me dropping it anytime soon.

It's a great, pretty polished game that offers a lot of fun for your group of friends. 

Positive:
+ So far no bugs found. Game feels very polished.
+ Under 20 bucks.
+ Haven't laughed that hard in a long time.
+ Weapons to use in battle. 
+ The graphics style is cute, fitting of the game and looks fun.
+ The games menu is simple to understand, it's easy to create a lobby, add friends and chose a game mode.
+ Controller support is super easy. PS4 controllers are supported as well (not always the case). 
+ There are several game modes (minigames, like a soccer mode) to play with your friends online/locally, which are a ton of fun.
+ You can play in local split screen (tried it with only two players though), with two controllers (PC)!

Neutral: Haven't played online with other people than my friends, so can't comment on that.
Neutral: Yes, there is an ingame shop but it's pretty non-intrusive. You don't have to buy more stuff to have fun.

Negative:
- Always online.
- Sometimes the loading screens are a bit long but nothing too bad.
- Grabbing/using weapons sometimes is super frustrating.

147343272,english,"Let's be honest. I am from what someone would call ""a region with restricted access"". I.e. China. I am writing this review partly because of the grudge accumulated from the years of waiting, being mistreated and outright abused, and partly because of the necessity of clarifying why we, as a whole, have such a negative attitude towards Recreate, the company that made this Game. I am writing this in English so that all of you, the honest players, can take a peek at what happened behind the colourful screen.

## Can We Talk About the Game First?

Sure. Party Animals is, as you've guessed from the name, a party game. It follows the slapstick formula with cute, fluffy animals as the dressing. It is visually appealing and is an easy pick-up for players at all levels.

The control is intentionally awkward so it fits the ""everyone can have fun"" party game style. You don't have to worry about someone being too pro at the game that it would crush the competition. But this awkwardness takes some time to get used to. For starters, you can't really control where you are facing and the pick-and-grab mechanism will get in the way if you spam the grab button, trying to pick up the key item.

Aside from the brawl, there are a lot of minigames that spice up the tone. But what minigame you get to play depends on the roll of the dice (and the minds of other players). Each round, you get 3 randomly selected maps to vote for.

The biggest downside is the **lack of local multiplayer**. As a party game, it is a courageous decision not to have a local multiplayer mode. My guess is that all the maps are designed around the 8-player versus mode. Typical 4-player mode won't make the cut.

The price point is also a bit too high for a party game. Oh, it might not be the case for YOUR region. In addition to the microtransaction built-in, I honestly don't know what should I feel. I paid a premium for this Game, only to be hit by a gacha machine in the face.

I guess it's a good time to explain the grudge.

## Why the Negativity?

As you may have known, Recreate is a Chinese company. I am not hinting about all the conspiracies revolving around privacy issues and data breaching -- it's too bland even for an avid conspiracy theorist. I am talking about the aspect of community management.

Recreate, at least in the domestic market, did not perform well in community management. Back in late 2019, when everything was still in the good ol' order, Recreate had released a beta version of the Game. The Game was already well-polished. We were all hyped and expected its release.

However, this is where it all started to go downhill.

It starts with the delays. Well, I guess that's a norm for game development. They always delay. But a three-year delay is more than what we can manage. During the Pandemic, while we were staying indoors, longing for a game for distraction, Recreate had chosen to ""perfect"" their work. They wanted ""a better hair rendition"" for the animal avatars. Okay, it's their artistic decisions. I won't judge. But what we have here is something practically identical to the 2019 demo. I guess they have improved the hair rendering code so it can run on a lower-end machine. (What's funny is that this fine hair rendering looks quite strange on Xbox such that some are questioning why the animals look jagged. I think they have fixed this issue but, still!)

If it's only that simple, I don't think it deserves such a bad rating.

As I have stated from the start, it all comes down to the community management. Party Animals was officially announced to the domestic market as early as 2020. But for all these years, there is virtually no official announcement made. No devlogs. No progress indication. Nothing. However, they haven't missed any international game events -- there were ads being made.

I mean, really? You have the manhours to make those ads, but not posting a tweet about where the project is going? Seriously?

I guess ads also count, at least they can let us take a peek at what the game would be, followed by a date that's either too vague or will get delayed (again). They didn't even bother to add a Chinese subtitle. All the press materials come in English first.

Fine. I'll take that as a try of i18n. Recreate wants to ship the game overseas. They are an ambitious company. But it just nudges the domestic market in a wrong way.

And then, the utterly tone-deaf interviews landed. Producer Luo, I remember that you said you wanted to make a ""perfect game"". Is this what you've dreamed of? Maybe. It's glitch-free. It is perfect in the sense that it runs without a hiccup. But a game is consumed with paratexts. A game cannot be played in a vacuum, in an idealized plane. I don't want to be harsh towards the developers and artists working for Recreate, but Animal Party is a dumpster fire and you know it. Are your servers stressing out? Should we ""buy the game but never play it""? Because ""as soon as we started playing it, [you are] losing money""? I know it's meant as a joke. It's a joke that nobody laughed.

98 CNY. Is this the price you are asking for? For a party game? Sure, I can afford that. But you chose to not add local multiplayer. It means if I wanted to invite my friends to play this game, they would have to pay for a copy themselves! That's a red bank note a pop! Let's have a check on other party games. Almost all of them are below 50 CNY. For those who didn't see the problem: imagine that this game asks for $40 or more, will you be so tolerant to microtransactions? Will you still think that ""fluffy animal cute""?

About the controversial naming, I'd left it aside. Again, those are jokes, whether intentional or not, that got nobody laughing. Well, maybe some laughed. Puns to vulgar terms always work as a filler. At least the name was addressed before the launch. I'll give it a pass.

I'd like to address some additional operations from Recreate in the domestic market. We do have a homegrown gaming community and it is as toxic and chaotic as yours. In the Party Animals board, there is not a single negative review of the game. You should really give the board moderator a raise. They are developing tenosynovitis just from swinging the ban hammer too much.

## Can Recreate Redeem Itself?

Now the Game is finally released for good. We laughed, we wept.

A game company, no matter the size, can always redeem itself. But not by doing the wrong thing one after another. None of the problems were unredeemable, but without proper treatment, they would accumulate and finally burst.

The game itself is of great quality (in terms of overall robustness). But the community disaster has already happened. Let's see if Recreate can come up with something better to turn this thumb upside-down.

Oh, by the way, if the game becomes F2P in a year (with boosted microtransactions), I would consider it a backstabbing move and this review will become settled.",1696066959,1696066959,FALSE,635,57,0.6717387437820433,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198166608352,116,5,187,0,187,1696000077
147341814,english,"Great party game with friends, and as long as you silence in-game voice chat then solo Quick Play is fine as well. Game is best if you have a few friends to hop into Quick Play with, or enough to play Custom matches against one another. It has some flaws, listed below, but it won't stop me from recommending a solidly fun game where the only in-game transactions are for wholly unneeded skins. 

The game is very good but has some flaws/things that lack proper explaining;
- The heavy punch (sprint punch) has hitbox issues galore, it seems. Sometimes it KO's in one hit, other times it bounces off people ineffectively from the same rough distance and angle as a KO punch. It's hard to gauge why it's not very consistent. Lag? Comedy? Who knows. 
- Some maps are worse for dead players to throw things at players in [yes, when you die you get to throw objects at the active players; it's neat/comedic], and sometimes the thrown item is *wildly* off course. And sometimes a thrown item KO's a person when it hits them and sometimes it doesn't even if it's hitting them the same way that the one that KO'd them did. It's confusing. 
- Price of skins could stand to be lower. $10 a pop is a little steep feeling. Not League of Legends or DotA steep, but not particularly inexpensive. 
- The worst part of the game overall is really just the players, per any multiplayer game. Lots of whiners on here quitting as soon as the game map they don't want is voted in favor of and complaining about getting leaver penalties. Losers. Matches last between 5-10 minutes, suck it up. 
- Speaking of quitters; if someone quits, they're replaced with an AI player. Sometimes they seem very good at the map objectives (like Beast Ball [football]) and other times they stand in areas and just die (Winter is Coming/bonfire map). Some consistency would be nice.

The game looks like a colorful cartoon, with the animals having funny expressions and movements that make the game even more charming and entertaining.

What I find most awesome about Party Animals is how unpredictable and creative it is. You never really know what's going to happen next in a match because there are all sorts of crazy weapons, hazards, and surprises that can completely change the game. From crossbows to plungers to bombs, you can use all sorts of items to either get an advantage or mess with your opponents.

Another great thing about Party Animals is that it's a really social game. You can play with your friends, either online or in the same room, and it's always a blast. You'll laugh a lot and probably tease each other too. Plus, you can also meet new friends or rivals by jumping into public matches with strangers.

Party animals plays very well overall; I enjoy the physics based stuff a lot. With friends it's even more fun when you're in a discord call and you can hear everyone giggle and having a good time

I'm going to recommend this game despite my surprise from the in-game purchases. The reason I do this is because this model actually made me realize, that the overall audience is a casual one.

When I first heard about the game, it was on a youtube trailer without mention of a PC version. What it did do however was advertise it on xbox. This is important because my theory is that they are targeting folks with Game pass.

The use-case that comes to mind is a casual player finds out about the game and picks it up because they don't have to pay 20$ when gamepass is a thing. Given this, the game itself can make up for smaller costs by using the nemo bucks and battle-pass-like format.

I don't need to go into an entire explanation, but if you catch my drift, I think it's fine so as long as you get it knowing what it has out of the box. The mechanics are generally overall fun with friends, so I'm personally just going to be enjoying the base game. Anything you buy isn't pay to win and is purely aesthetics which can be obtained overtime. Since it's just that, and core gameplay is always available, I'm entirely ok just enjoying it as-is.",1696021506,1696021597,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198105203752,0,13,1634,0,422,1702782822

I would definitely recommend this game to people who are parents and looking for a fun game to let their kids play. Or adults who never let their inner child die.

My only gripe with it, is limited game modes. And the fact you cant chose between 'i want to queue for solo modes' or 'i want to queue for team modes'. I think there should be an option to toggle which type of game-modes you want to play--- such as Last Stand or more cooperative modes like Fluffy Redemption/Trebuchet within Quick matches would go a long way in tailoring some customizability to the gameplay experience to those who have friends with busy schedules and cannot get everyone to sit down for a Custom Game lobby with more than 4 players.

Controls are simple and easy but you have to learn how to move your character properly to fight well.

8 animals beat the shit out of each other with fists, feet, heads and whatever weapon is lying around but every level has an environmental hazard that gets worse/more restricting over time to stop the game from going too long and forcing players to move and fight.
It also has a team mode where you play in two teams of 4v4 and have an objective to fight over while stopping the other team from doing the same.

Only a few problems;
No offline mode, doesn't bother me
Remote Play is always split screen, fine with two players

-how long you stay knocked out seems to be random as well as what it's going to take to get knocked out.
-everything seems very RNG
-playing with randoms is just going to piss you off because griefing is so easy to do especially in teams based mini games.
-also planned on having this be an offline game but you have to have it always online, and split screen is not the best of experiences.

It's unfortunate that the wording of the description hinted at offline mode when in reality was not the case.

Though I understand the issue with not having servers for all the parts of the world. That's not great. Monetization I am not sure about? I get the price for skins is pretty high, but the game also gives you a damn ton of free currency. I am sure there will be other ways to earn ingame currency as well later on, something like a free season pass or something. We will see. But up until level 100 (this will take you around 50 hours) you earn a lot.

Anyway, the game is awesome. It's super fun and addictive. Playing solo is not that great, but if you have at least one friend, it becomes incredible. This will make you laugh a year worth. Also, compared to other similar games, the maps with objectives are pretty fun and they keep the game more interesting than if you only had deathmatch arenas.

147271795,english,"I played this game Live on Kick (OffTarget on Kick) and the stream was mad fun.
You can host custom lobbies and then invite 3 friends to play in public lobbies.

When comes to 4 players per team maps (2 teams)
You and your 3 friends can do actual good strats.

When comes down to duo maps (4 teams of 2)
You can yell out ""Get the red guy"" and have temporary alliance with another duo.

Over all this is among one of the best games to play with your community.
And if anyone is looking for more players to play with, feel free to visit my stream someday and meet new players!

Downfalls to the game: 

1. There is not enough stages or maps to play.
Seems like its the same 4 or 5 stages on rotate.

2. There is a punishment for leaving mid-game, while I agree games should do this...
This game is just meant for fun so its kinda odd for this specific feature to be in the game.

3. Seems to lack features in general.
You only got two options Public matches and Custom matches.

I do not know what else you could add to the game to be variety.
But at least bring in more stages and maps.

Specifically Me and my chat loved the 4v4 stages the most
I do recommend bringing more of them in the game.

The most terrible game designs I've ever seen in a video game, majority of levels are simply not fun and it's based on pure luck and randomness.

Everything's random.
I know it's a silly game but at some point there needs to have concrete controls over your actions that WORK.
Climbing? punching? it's all hit or miss if it works or not or if you can come back up or not, whatever your stamina is, I've played 17 hours through all the levels many times, inputs won't trigger at times or your character's animation will get in the way.
If it's desync (which would happen 80% of the time), then they need to fix this ASAP.

Blunt melee weapons are OP, once you get used to the swing you can clear a map like Ice Breaker or Isiban in 2 minutes without much trouble, knocking out someone is one thing but eliminating a player by hitting them with a melee is retarded.

AFK players everywhere without consequences but if YOU leave you get a 2-minute ban, they can be AFK 5 minutes they won't get kicked out, who's stupid idea was that at Recreate Games??

There's a fake report button in-game like Fall Guys and RL had that probably go in their junk mails, hackers will be coming in flock soon (already have some)

Lack of outfits, I have 40k cookies and around 4k nemos after 17 hours and I bought a few outfits, the same outfits come back week after week in the store, everything else is with eggs and achievements, what's the point of having so many cookies and nemos then?

147266012,english,"Out of every video game that suffers from the horrible idea that leaving a game should be punished, this game SHOULD NOT HAVE THAT FEATURE. This game is FOR FUN, why would you actively determent your game by making it less fun. I am not taking away from other people's fun by leaving the game, therefore I should not have to play through the most unfun parts of the game. All because of some horrible feature created for competitive games, this game suffers from a lot; but this is the biggest issue and that's saying something both good and very-very bad. For devs that seem fairly in-touch, this is the biggest left-field out-of-touch feature they could add to this game.

For anyone wondering, the average game is 5-10 minutes; therefore quitting and recieving the punishment if faster than playing through the maps you don't wish to play.

1. First and foremost, remove the absolute largest anti-fun feature created in videogaming history.

2. Add a map filter than removes the ability to queue for maps I don't want to play. No, I dont want to play straight line map with no depth, no I don't want to play circle map with the nothing but something that sucks the players towards the middle.

147253488,english,"I previously had a negative review due to what seems to a bit of confusion. Some people are reporting the game cannot be played offline at all, others say you can, still others say only on certain platforms. So if you had any doubt about that and need to play this game offline, do some research before you buy because depending on your circumstances it may not work. I keep finding conflicting information, so I'm leaving it out of this review for now.

Assuming you do have online capacity however, this game is incredible. It's very clearly just gang beasts but with cute animals, but it really works. The cute animals give it a unique feel and make it stand out, and there was always a thrill in the early part of the game when you would see a new animal for the first time. You have obvious ones like dogs, cats, and rabbits, but some real odd balls that were a treat to see. They did a really good job of making the other game modes fun, I actually prefer some like the train mini game to some of the pvp maps like the ice one. 

The game does have a few weak points. Matchmaking is buggy right now and if you don't leave a match after the end and instead instant queue for another one, it often either crashes the game or gets you stuck in an endless loading screen. The game is heavily lootbox / microtransaction filled and many cosmetics (and even some characters) seem to only be available through these. You can get a few loot boxes from levels but after you reach max you would have to spend real money to roll the dice. I've seen about 30 different animals (albeit about 1/3 are variations of dogs and cats) and while that is definitely a lot I'm already itching for more. The game just came out so no telling how often updates will arrive but if they are frequent I think this game will last a long time. 

Lastly, this game really needs to have local multiplayer. It might already have this, but once again I have seen very conflicting information, and it seems like it is also platform related. In some capacity it seems at least one version of the game does have this, but it's very odd that it is not universal.",1695957763,1696168754,TRUE,1,0,0.5238095521926879,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198074479203,0,48,1212,192,663,1706830266

Secondly, the internet requirement can be lame if you were expecting to be able to play offline but NONE of the top online games like this had offline capabilities. Fall Guys was $20 when it released and they didn't have it either.

Now that I've addressed my thoughts on THOSE issues, the game itself is incredibly fun. It's funny and my son and I highly enjoy it.

It should be easier to pick up weapons too, instead of having to drag them the right way. 

Main problem of the game is there's no effort to cultivate a positive community so you get a lot of sweatlords and trolls which make it unfun to play.

The winter last stand one is especially grievous.

This is not a free to play game and yet has expensive legendary cosmetic microtransactions, those cost more than the game itself, and even though you can get all in-game currencies by leveling up your (free) battle pass, it will take several weeks of playing daily to grind enough for one legendary cosmetic.

You don't get all available animals with your purchase, some are locked and have to grind for them. Getting new no-costume/basic color animals is cheap at least, but availability to purchase some of them are on daily store rotations or through gacha mechanics (loot boxes / surprise eggs) ... c'mon!

This game has all of your standard live-service / mobile-games style of monetization. Not as predatory as games like Diablo Immortal since it's all cosmetic...

Ultimately, its a really great party game with friends, but changes are needed so I can recommend it:

- Let me quickmatch with a local party.
- Add playlists to quickmatch into, depending on my party. Solo, couples, 4p teams, solo only teams.
- Add real offline mode, I want to do offline lan parties at friends house without internet.
- Free camera with zoom and better split-screen. It's way too cropped.

147233144,english,"Simple, inexpensive. Genuinely a fantastic time. Cannot recommend enough!

I play this nightly with my husband since it released and we both love it. It's challenging but not in the sense that it requires a lot of skill. Personally, I do not feel like the match-ups are unfair nor do I feel like I am disadvantaged at any time and I like the voting feature where you have a say in which map you can play on. Even if you're playing the same map 3 or 4 times in a row, each match-up is different and there's always an equal opportunity for everyone to potentially win. Once you're knocked out for the round, you still get to play on in the sense that you can throw things at people rather than just sit and spectate. The abilities of your fighter are the same as any other person you're playing with our against and so long as that never changes, it's great. 

This game has the option for in-game purchases with RMT, however, thanks to how the rewards system is set up, there is no need to purchase any in-game currency to get what you want from the shop. There is zero pay to win aspect. I also love that there is a lot to choose from as far as the cosmetic selection goes, even with options to win/purchase/play as an animal dressed as popular IP! While there is the aspect of micro-transactions, Party Animals does not feel micro-transactiony. You are literally only buying a skin - nothing more than a cosmetic.

The microtransactions in the game aren't nearly bad as they seem, playing at a semi consistent level would allow you to earn a good portion of the things in the game, as you level up you earn rewards and some of the rewards are the Premium currency, the amount you get atleast allows you to spin the Item Machine 1 time, you also earn coins for the machine by leveling up.

Let me start off with [b] WOW! [/b] I took no notice of this during the Xbox Showcase as I was more interested in Forza Motorsport at the time, but after seeing a friend play this game through VC in discord I was blown away by the amazing gameplay and wanted to get the game to play it just for the sake of playing. (And of course play with my friend...) [spoiler] That's [b] WHEN [/b] she wants to play with me ofc... [/spoiler]

The Gameplay is so great! I can't stop playing this game whether I'm getting head bonked, hit by a frying pan or just being fried from accidentally stepping into the train's system. It has so many game modes that you can play from Duos to teams and from American Football, surviving the conditions or just surviving a black hole. 

Honestly I really don't mind if I have to stay online just to enjoy the game, and the micro transactions don't bother me but you know that's the main part of the game industry [b] BUT [/b] with this game you can earn the items by levelling up so it's not all doom and gloom behind a paywall. 

I really think the devs have hit the jackpot with this idea and I cannot wait for new updates to come to the game!

Alright, let's talk about ""Party Animals,"" and yes, it's tough not to mention ""Gang Beasts"" because, well, they're like siblings. 
Both are chaotic, physics-based brawlers that thrive on the unpredictability of flinging cuddly creatures at each other.

""Party Animals"" doesn't quite reach the beastly heights of its counterpart, but it's got its own brand of charm. They've swapped out the gelatinous, gelatine-hued fighters for fluffy, adorable animals. These furballs toss each other off bridges into seemingly bottomless pools of water, and it's as brutal as it is hilarious.

What sets it apart, though, is the variety of maps. From crumbling bridges to indoor arenas with arcade machines, each one is a delightful dose of fun. Some even bring in unique challenges like rising poison gas or encroaching cold. They're not just visually appealing; they add depth to the chaos.

Now, if you've played ""Gang Beasts,"" you're familiar with the wonky physics controls. In ""Party Animals,"" it's no different; You're flailing around like a caffeinated octopus trying to perform open-heart surgery. 

But that's part of the charm. The only time you feel truly in control is when you're delivering a dropkick, which is strangely satisfying.

I've had a blast playing ""Party Animals"" with friends, and it's clear that this game is meant to be shared. You can go wild with up to eight players online or have a cozy couch session with four players on a local console.

At launch, there's not an overwhelming variety of game modes, but they're a hoot. ""Last Stand"" is the classic mode you'll probably enjoy the most. Custom games can get a bit repetitive since you often play the same map multiple times. But some maps, like the sinking submarine level, are so fun they don't get old.

Then there's ""Team Score Mode,"" offering a mix of mini-games, from football-ish to train racing. It's bizarre but adds to the variety.

""Party Animals"" throws in some monetization with XP to unlock cosmetics and rewards. While there's a gacha-style system, it's not overly aggressive, and you can unlock most rewards in-game.

So, ""Party Animals"" is off to a solid start. It looks great, plays well, and is a blast with friends. It might not change your life, especially if you're a ""Gang Beasts"" veteran, but if you've never experienced the joy of a physics brawler, ""Party Animals"" is a great entry point for this genre.",1695849651,1695885392,TRUE,8,0,0.5570389628410339,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561199147028014,2217,386,645,0,645,1695764341

147154760,english,"DO NOT PURCHASE IN IT'S CURRENT STATE

This game has potential, but it is making so many basic mistakes, like it hasn't been in development for years. They barely demoed the game and it shows sadly.
- Sports modes are incredibly dull and time consuming.
- Grabbing rarely works correctly, especially for weapons and often other players. You will grab items incorrectly many times, as well as grabbing things you dont want to. The worst case of grabbing is the ice level, where it wont grab onto the side properly a lot of the time so you are eliminated.
- Climbing (jumping whilst holding) is really bad when you reach a ledge, which only gives more chance for other players to land an easy hit on you.
- Physics are sometimes just randomly bad, throwing you for no reason, you can hit someone 10 times, they hit you once and you're knocked out. I think there's exploit abuse going on.
- No visible indicator of your health, so you have no idea how hurt you are.
- Win rules are strange for some maps, like the submarine one, you can be the last on the submarine yet not win because there is someone far away in the water with a little more stamina?!

I really hope these things are fixed, it has a long way to go and I can't believe the game is released in this state. I will give it a few months and if it hasn't changed I will be asking for a refund. I hope to change my review sometime, right now playing the concept and art of the game is great, but it's so frustrating to play and I always leave feeling worse than when I started.",1695846466,1698358201,FALSE,1,0,0.5258620381355285,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198157776520,517,57,1447,0,760,1698411050

The music and visuals are perfectly done to make the game easy to run, visually appealing and doesn't you turning off the music or sound effects.
Some of my favourite maps include Broken Arrow (a plane where teams compete to knock each other off), Blackhole Lab (where a blackhole periodically spawns in the centre above a hole, dragging people to their death), and Fluffy Redemption (a team mode where you have to move coal to the furnace at the front of your train while trying to sabotage the enemy).

I'm with Pluhh, you're just b*tchen and moaning about simple things you can work around. GROW UP! and just enjoy the game for what it is. we haven't had a game like this since gang beast (with the exception of Rubber Bandits) and just because it's missing some small ass details that will be fixed given time you have to go and whine about it.

 I think Demon puts it perfectly when it comes to micro-transaction """"""people mentioning micro-transactions fail to realize that you get the money from playing. NOTHING is forcing you to pay real money. I'm only level 12 and I have enough of the treats to buy the entire fucking store. Yeah, the little money may take longer, but it's not in your face that you can buy it with real money."""""""""" credit: Demon. Yes Lau makes a great point in raising the fact that ""the currency is capped to level 100"" but then that's what you should be complaining about and even then they will more than likely change that. I believe that microtransactions are great when it comes to indie games/ devs (as long as they don't act like a paywall and force you to buy things), they allow people to support the creators which in turn allows for/pay for the game to continue to be updated and also can keep servers up for a longer period meaning you get to play more. I understand hating micro-transactions when it comes to big companies like Activation and Ubisoft who just take the money for themselves but when you have an indie game you just know that the money will be used to better and improve the game. 
[h3] This is RIDICULOUS [/h3]
Your statement about ""The game modes"" is f**king ridiculous, you're b*tchen about a feature that adds variety, it's your choice what mode you play with friends but I'm sorry that not everyone like a vanilla ass life like you, where you just sit at your computer jacking off and complaining about every detail of a game, even if that detail drastically improves it such as having multiple modes. Having multiple game modes allows for hours of variating fun where if you get bored of a certain mode then you can change it, also allows players to keep coming back to the game. Now I get that you may not have many friends to play with (maybe the occasional one that you bump into as you shop for adult diapers)  so you have to play the quick match mode in which you cannot choose to do solely free for all, but this is because ... wait....you will never guess..... THERE ARE PEOPLE OTHER THAN YOU!!!, people who enjoy having a goal in life along with variation in what and how they play. I genuinely think this may be the dumbest complaint I have ever heard in my life.
[h3] What you were right about [/h3]
The only thing I agree with you on is the quit penalty as you stated""""This game isn't Valorant or CSGO. Why is there a leave penalty when people can join mid-match if someone leaves? If someone (like me) doesnt want to play buzzball or soccer for the 2rd or 3th time in a row and wants to play the elimination style modes instead.""""

147139449,english,"[h1] There is potential, but this needs a lot of work. [/h1]

I've had this game on my wishlist for three years, and my enthusiasm has been met with disappointment. I have a soft spot for whimsical indie games of this nature, as there's nothing quite as enjoyable to me as partaking in party games with a lively group of friends. The inclusion of ragdoll mechanics and the like only amplifies the hilarity. Games such as Gang Beasts and Human: Fall Flat have certainly resonated with me.

My anticipation for this particular game was quite high; however, I must express my dissatisfaction with the mechanics, which fall short of expectations for a game of this genre. Unlike its counterparts, it lacks the ability to independently control each hand. Consequently, the gameplay devolves into a chaotic button-mashing frenzy, reliant on spamming the punch button in hopes of achieving a knockout. Regrettably, there is no discernible skill differential or means to genuinely outperform one's opponent. Instead, it boils down to aimless floundering, with the victor determined largely by chance.

I firmly believe that this game harbors substantial potential if only the developers would adopt combat mechanics akin to those found in Gang Beasts, where players possess a sense of control over the outcome of their interactions. Furthermore, the climbing mechanics in this game appear to be subject to random outcomes. One must simply press the jump and grab buttons and hope for the best, as the results can vary widely. Sometimes, a character effortlessly returns to a platform with a single jump, while on other occasions, it takes five attempts or more. This disparity creates a palpable disconnection between the controller and one's in-game character.

To truly elevate this game to excellence, it is my sincere suggestion that the developers introduce individual arm control for combat, climbing, and grabbing. This adjustment, I believe, would undoubtedly enhance the overall experience and propel this game to the top tier of its genre.",1695833262,1695833262,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198824123901,0,1,362,0,214,1697341579

To me, this is one of the most charming and beautiful games to come out in awhile, and is many times better/more fun than Fall Guys.

All loot boxes/microtransactions are optional and cosmetic. People complain about EA's Star Wars being a truly corrupted microtransaction system because it actually affected game-play/progression.  Here, it's only skins that don't affect gameplay, and yet it's still being labeled as predatory.  Why does the goal-post keep getting moved?

I think the artists and designers, at the very least, should be very proud of their achievement here.  This game had me and my gf laughing for hours and had an absolute blast.

147134217,english,"[h1] Ok, so lets clear some things up. [/h1]

This game has mixed reviews, which this game [b] definitely does not [/b] deserve. 

Lots of people are giving this game negative reviews because of the fact that the game does not have an 'offline' singe-player mode, or because of the fact that the game has micro-transactions.

[h2] Let's start with the offline single-player mode. [/h2]

To clear things up; the game [b] DOES [/b] support couch split-screen co-op. The only thing it doesn't support is offline play, as you need an online connection to be able to play the game at all. I do understand people being upset about this, as the devs could have been more clear about this, and shouldn't have used the word 'offline' in the game description (which they removed as of now).  

[h2] Micro-transactions [/h2]

In no way is this game pay-to-win. All the micro-transactions in this game are cosmetic, and don't give you an advantage in any way. Matter of fact, both types of currency's are obtainable through just playing the game, and completing weekly/daily challenges! Which means that if you want to spend money to get your characters to look different, go ahead! But it's also obtainable by just playing the game and saving up the currency you get!

[h2] Conclusion [/h2]

Even though i haven't played a lot yet, I can definitely say that I love this game. If you liked Gang Beasts, you're gonna love this one. The gameplay is almost identical, though it feels a little less clunky, and more controllable. Also the fact that this game adds quite some weapons to use, quite a lot of maps on release, and several game-modes to play, makes it so the game doesn't get old quick (which I did have with Gang Beasts). If the devs continue to update the game with more maps, game-modes, weapons and characters (which they are actively doing right now), this game is going to be fun, and fresh for a long time!

If you liked Gang Beasts, you're definitely gonna love this one. Don't let the reviews fool you, the game is a blast! Especially with friends.",1695827954,1695827954,TRUE,348,14,0.7867286205291748,21,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198059332196,187,13,1332,59,457,1706999520
147133812,english,"I don’t usually write reviews. But here is my honest opinion on it on many topics I’ve read. 

Currency: Honestly I feel it’s fair, it’s expensive yes, BUT here is what people are not seeing in the game. There is free battle pass to earn money in game and it’s REALLY easy. I got a $30 skin for free for just playing the game and im only level 18 in the battle pass. There is 100 levels to this battle pass with tons of money you can earn, that’s why I think it’s fair how they priced everything for everyone who is complaining about how expensive it is, it really isn’t. Just play the game. 

Next issue: Online multiplayer, I don’t really see many issues with lag it’s pretty stable. So that’s a plus! 

Bugs: I’ve noticed a few things that don’t make sense and im not sure if each animal has its own weight? But I got killed with one bomb since you have health when playing, but then there was this gorilla who got hit with 6 bombs and hit in the head with a shovel multiple times and didn’t die. How does that make sense? I think it’s a bug regarding the characters size and tallness because there is a map with poison, and I can be knocked out for a second and I will die in the poison, while a goose who is longer neck won’t die in that poison because I feel most of the body isn’t in the poison so it doesn’t trigger. Those are really the only bugs I’ve seen that I feel characters might have their own weight in it. 

Rating of game: I give it a solid 7/10 just because it’s so fun with friends but when you are paired up with a stranger disconnecting or who doesn’t really know what they are doing and throwing you off when you are teammates can be frustrating. I feel they should have it if you are intentionally throwing off teammates or killing them constantly to be warned for the behavior. Accidents can happen so it would have to truly be monitored on how they are acting to have the system warn them.

147076924,english,"I'm going to directly compare this game to Gang Beasts in my review because they are very similar games, although in my opinion, Gang Beasts is better. I'll explain by telling you the difference between the games.


In Gang Beasts, you stay down longer each time you get knocked out, with your first time getting knocked out being only a second unconscious. And then going closer to knockout #10, you'll be down for around 6 seconds. So you have lives, in a way, because even if someone knows how to throw, then they won't have time to throw you off the edge unless you got knocked out right next to one.

In Party Animals, how long you stay down is seemingly random. I'm unsure without testing it, but it could be tied to your stamina, but I've been insta-knocked out on Spawn and been out for at least 4 seconds before, so I don't believe it's fully tied to stamina if at all. But in Party Animals, it's luck based on if this knockout is gonna be the killer for you, and if you spawn right next to somebody, you've got a 50/50 chance. And with the added caveat that there's a designated throw button and the fact that knockouts send you meters away, you can easily be thrown off map the second you get knocked out, if the blast from the punch didn't do it for you already.

In Gang Beasts, there is no stamina bar except for an invisible one when climbing or ganging from something in general. Just basic attacks and jump attacks, which are stronger. Bodies were heavy as they realistically are, so you had to be sure to pick someone up in the right way to throw them, and then get them right near the edge.

In Party Animals, stamina is a key feature, and you do more damage based on how much stamina you have. On top of that, running punches and dropkicks are heavy attacks so KO's happen pretty quickly. If you are out of stamina and get knocked out, it's an instant death. As well as if you land in water without stamina, it's an instant death. So juggling your stamina bar while fighting your opponents is something you always have to keep watch on, which takes away a bit of the fun of just beating the shit out of your friends and strangers. In my opinion, simple works better with brawlers like this. And you'd think that'd it'd be less random with these kinds of systems, but somehow it's not.

In Gang Beasts, every customization item is free and available to you, with options to save different presets.

In Party Animals, monetization is a big part of the game. While you can earn the three different currencies from leveling up; once you hit that level cap, buying is your only way to get currency until they release a battle pass, which will also cost money.

In Gang Beasts, controls are limb based and deliberate. Climbing is one hand a time, and grabbing onto one specific thing purposefully is entirely possible.

In Party Animals, climbing controls are simpler, but more random. You throw  yourself upwards by launching yourself up, letting go, and grabbing on again. But if the surface isn't entirely flat, or somebody is in your way, prepare to fall all the way down because when you climb, you let go with both hands each raise in height, so if your arms don't connect, you fall. And might even get knocked out when you land as well.

There are more comparisons to make such as map designs and modes, but this would be way too long of a review. All in all, this game is fun for a little, while Gang Beats is fun for a while. If Boneloaf would update Gang Beasts, it would be top of the charts again.",1695755772,1695755812,FALSE,4,1,0.4823529422283172,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198396870063,468,31,897,3,476,1706335286

The battle pass style of leveling has tons of rewards from in-game currency to paid currency and tons of skins, profile pictures, and profile backgrounds. I have barely seen things sold for crazy amounts and even then I have earned enough to buy multiple skins and re-rolls of the mystery box machine.

147073433,english,"""Party Animals"" Review:

---

**Pros:**

1. **Global Reach:** The game provides global servers, catering to players in North America, Asia, and Europe, ensuring a broad player base and improved matchmaking.
   
---

**Cons:**

1. **Matchmaking Penalties:** A significant drawback is the severe penalty for canceling a matchmaking search. Even if you've just entered the matchmaking queue and opt out within seconds, you're subjected to a wait time. This is especially frustrating for players who may need to adjust settings or have genuine reasons to leave the search.
   
2. **Controller vs. Keyboard & Mouse:** For those who prefer playing with a controller, the game seems to be at a disadvantage when compared to the keyboard and mouse setup. This might be a turn-off for players who are more comfortable with a controller.

3. **Limited Asian Server Nodes:** While the game offers global servers, the Asian servers only provide a Chinese node. This could potentially lead to latency issues for players in other Asian countries.

4. **AI Teammates:** Having AI teammates against real players isn't the best experience. This can lead to unbalanced matches and diminish the competitive spirit of the game. It's particularly frustrating when faced with this issue multiple times in succession.

---

**Verdict:** 

""Party Animals"" presents a mixed bag of experiences. While it promises global reach with its servers, some of its features, like the strict matchmaking penalties and the limited Asian server nodes, can be deterrents for players. If the developers address these issues, the game has the potential to offer a more enjoyable experience for all players.",1695751525,1695751525,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198162265052,489,19,878,0,334,1704421789

Game is fun to play with friends, and even if you don't have friends, there are enough maps and game modes that it's rewarding to play alone. 

Cosmetics really aren't that expensive. In 5 hrs I've earned enough currency to buy any of the premium skins I want... If you do weekly challenges, you'll get 20% of the amount of currency needed for a premium (most expensive types) of skin per week, and even more through leveling up. The only thing that feels a bit off are the surprise eggs, because after you earn the 10 or so through leveling up, the only way to get those blind draw skins are with money.

I think down the road they'll either need to add more levels to go through, or add in cheap battle passes to sustain the game.

147032089,english,"""O Império Romano foi a terceira fase da civilização romana, segundo a periodização utilizada pelos historiadores. Esse período iniciou-se em 27 a.C., com a coroação de Otávio como imperador de Roma, e estendeu-se até 476 d.C., quando o último imperador, Rômulo Augusto, foi destituído do trono. Tal evento colocou fim no império em sua porção ocidental.
Esse é o período da centralização do poder em Roma, pois ele migrou das mãos do Senado para a figura do imperador. O império é a fase do auge dessa civilização, pois ela havia alcançado seu máximo domínio territorial, mas, eventualmente, sua crise ocorreu, levando ao seu fim, no século V d.C.""
""A fase do Império Romano foi consequência da crise que Roma enfrentou nos dois últimos séculos da república. Essa crise deu-se por meio de convulsões sociais, revoltas de escravos, mas, sobretudo, por disputas de poder que levaram a guerras civis. A expansão territorial que Roma passou durante o período republicano resultou no surgimento de novas demandas políticas que reivindicavam certa centralização do poder.
A historiadora Mary Beard|1| afirma que a expansão territorial romana, por meio da anexação territorial das províncias (termo usado para definir as regiões conquistadas), criou debates no interior da política romana a respeito da administração do império e questões sobre o poder partilhado. Assim o poder que estava nas mãos do Senado passou a ser questionado.
Além disso, os generais romanos que participavam das campanhas de conquista de Roma ganharam popularidade e passaram a ter ambições políticas. Isso está relacionado principalmente com a profissionalização dos exércitos em Roma no século II a.C., o que contribuiu para que os militares se tornassem figuras realmente importantes.
A disputa pelo poder gerou guerras que desestabilizaram o império, fazendo com que fossem criados os triunviratos como forma de conter as disputas. Existiram dois triunviratos no final da República Romana, e ambos resultaram em novas guerras, novamente pelo controle do poder. O primeiro triunvirato viu Júlio César emergir como vencedor da disputa com Crasso e Pompeu. Em 46 a.C., ele se tornou ditador vitalício, possuindo plenos poderes sobre Roma.
Júlio César foi assassinado por membros do Senado em 44 a.C., e foi necessário formar um segundo triunvirato, composto por seus apoiadores. Esse triunvirato foi formado por Otávio, Marco Antônio e Lépido e também resultou em guerra. Ao final dessa disputa, Otávio saiu como vencedor.""

Gameplay Grade: A+

Party animals is family friendly casual type of game, where the player takes control of one of a selection of playable animals whose objective is to brawl it out over various game modes. Currently there are three modes available to play. Might not seem all that much but each one is enabled to be modified further with the game lobby settings.
[list]
    [*]Last Stand — Where you need to be the last one standing in a full out brawl. If a player has been knocked out, they are able to through stuff into the arena to the betterment or detriment of the surviving players.
    [*]Team Score — Here you’re set into at least 2 teams and trying to score points. When a team scores a point, the map will reset shortly after a quick replay showcasing the goofy ways people score points.
    [*]Arcade — in the last mode you and optionally your team must throw your opponents out the arena to win. Nothing more than that in this mode.

Items such as a frying pan to send folks flying, plunger that sticks to people, freeze gun for well freezing other players, a taser to try out electroshock therapy, and plenty of others goofy little things. So, if you like, you can be a rabbit with a baseball bat, smacking down a dragon only to be drop kicked by a cat in swat tactical gear inside of a blackhole generator.

At its heart this game is a party game which means it is meant to be played with friends, or with strangers if you do not have any via quick play option. However, I must admit, the game loses its luster after around 2 hours because everyone has their enjoyment for the day and watching animals smack each other with shovels stops being as funny as it used to. That is until next and folks are trash talking towards one another and just enjoying their time being spent among friends in discord. This is a game you do not play for long periods of time, but after a break this game reminds fun and enjoyable.

I would give the gameplay an A+ for outstanding work. This game knew what it wanted to be, and it achieved it in this category.

[H3] PRESENTATION [/H3]
Presentation Grade: B

The presentation within the game is phenomenal. The usage of bright colors makes things appear more cute then it actually is, which given game’s style choice helps it tremendously. In an age where a lot of game developers are trying to push more pixels and higher fidelity, they fail to realize that given time that their style choice will fade where games that went with a softer more bright color style will last far longer. For example, you can look towards the Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. The sound design is spot on especially with all the little items you can pick up and use. 

Yet the only real draw back within the presentation is that if you do creation content and have this game, you must disable the music within the game because it is copyrighted, thus if you publish videos or live stream it, you will get struck by the copyright system, and as of the time of posting there is no streamer mode. This is horrible because we live in the age of the internet, and does things that are counterproductive towards the age. No one would have much desire to share content of this game if they are going to get copyright struck.

Presentation earns a Solid B for doing the minimum to stand out but not going above and beyond.

[H3] DRAWBACKS [/H3]
Drawbacks Grade: F

Onto the negatives, this game does not feature an offline play mode in any capacity. Yes, you can play split screen locally however you must connect to an online server initially to be able to play. This takes away from the customer because say these servers go offline, then your game is no longer available to be played. For recent example of this look towards Payday 3. You can have your online services but allow players to play the game they of bought.

The next thing I’m going to bring up is not excusable. The original description of the game had blatantly said offline play was in the game. However, it was then later removed shortly after the game’s release due to backlash for not having said mode. The developers had given a news post on Wednesday September 20th stating that this was due a translation error. Granted things get lost in translation but you had 2 years to comb over everything since the last beta to launch. Even if was not meant to, you have falsely advertised your game. 

This game also has an in-game shop where you can exchange your money for paid currency in currency packs. Common practice in current affairs but they also do the thing where you cannot directly purchase the cute outfits you desire and will you will have left over currency. This is known tactic, which may be known as a “Dark Pattern” to direct the player to buy even more currency. Now I will state that a large number of outfits can be obtained through standard play given time, but that doesn’t excuse the fact that you can exchange your paid currency of a 2 to 15 rate to buy the earnable outfits much faster if you have the money. I also need point out that the shop store is a rotating one which is known to pressure people into buying things because they do not know when something will be available again if ever. Through leveling your account, you will earn up to $20ish dollars of paid currency for free. Some outfits could be more expensive than the game itself. You are also unable to purchase the outfits directly and must buy the currency packs.

There is also loot boxes but referred to as surprised eggs, you can earn a token during play via leveling up or by purchasing a spin via paid currency. As the game currently stands, you can only get set number of spins for free from leveling up. It reminds to be seen if the player will be able to earn more after reaching max level. If I recall Loot boxes are banned in the Netherlands and legislation around the world is picking up about the issue.

Either through lack of attention, incompetence, or outright direct design, this game has a Dark Pattern. If you like to have a thorough explanation or further information, The Youtube channels Techquickie and Extra history have done video content that explains this further then I can in this steam review due to character limitations. In short, this game will never ask for your confirmation when you purchase something. The F.T.C. here in the United States has been battling these types of issues in court cases. Please add a confirmation button to the game.

[H3] FOOTNOTES [/H3]
Final Grade: C+

Greatness can be easily ruined by horrible actions, hopefully this game can improve upon the groundwork that has been laid. Party Animals can easily get an A+ but the drawbacks are too great. I want this game to be a success because video games are my hobby and I want the best for everyone. Sadly I would have to leave a not recommended here because there is no neutral setting in the process.

Consider joining the Steam curator group: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39651895/",1695673171,1695673274,FALSE,5,0,0.562043786,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198010957811,1241,34,1038,0,318,1701740131

147022342,english,"After almost 4 hours of playtime, I can not agree with any of the negative reviews. People are complaining about microtransation when I have yet to see a single sign that the game wants me to spend money on skins or to be better at the game. The only microtransactions that might be ingame, are the ones that let you purchase Nemo Bucks. They are NOT required and give you zero benefit except skins. There is also no pay-to-win factor to this game, it's all cosmetics.

You don't want the skins? Don't spend the money. A voluntary payment is not grounds for a negative review.

Now to the game:

Party Animals is a fun PvP game that lets you play adorable animals in different party games. Some are in teams, some are in duos. The controls are different but not difficult and just something that need a little bit of getting used to. I can personally say that me and my friends have laughed so much that our stomachs hurt from this game and I'm looking forward to all the fun we'll have in the future. 

The game has a level up system that lets you unlock A LOT of free things. Skins, Avatars, Avatar Frames etc., even ingame currency from Egg Coins, to Cookies and Nemo Bucks. You can also get Twitch drops like currency and a cute Twitch skin from there.

In the end, it's awesome. The pricing wasn't too high, the gameplay is hilarious, the games are super fun and the negative reviews are from people that clearly don't realize that every game nowadays has something that will require some form of small payment, be it lootboxes, skins, weapons etc. Party Animals is no different and at least those purchases aren't being rubbed in my face.

- You knock your opponent off the platform or into the frozen river several times and he comes back

- You receive a blow and stay stunned for 2x to 3x longer than your opponent, even if you also stunned him with 100% of your stamina

- When the opponent throws you, you die or freeze immediately, unlike them who always return[/b]

147005882,english,"Party Animals is a quirky game filled with amusing animal characters, each offering a variety of skins that you can acquire through an egg machine or by spending cookies and in-game currency earned by leveling up or by ""investing"" real money. With a vast selection to choose from, there's something for everyone. (except for animal abusers ig...)

The game truly shines when played with friends, creating memorable and hilarious moments. However, be prepared for a bit of chaos if someone in your group decides to become the disruptor instead of focusing on team tasks, leading to entertaining but often annoying battles and knockouts. (I'm that person, friends hate me... pls hug me and say it's gonna be alright...)

I'd recommend using a controller for a smoother and more enjoyable experience, as the mouse and keyboard combo may feel less intuitive. (and you'll most likely destroy your mouse by smashing it all over your desk)

The game's price point is a consideration. If you have friends to join in the fun, it's worth it. However, if you're planning to play solo, you might want to wait for a sale or explore other titles. Paying €18 for an online-only 'phone-style' game with additional microtransactions for characters and skins can seem a bit steep.

In terms of maps and game modes, Party Animals delivers enjoyable and well-crafted experiences. My only wish is that there were more maps to keep the gameplay even more diverse and exciting.

For my own experience, I've consistently had a blast playing Party Animals. However, I can't say the same for my friends, given that I tend to be making the game difficult for them. While I find the idea of spending extra money on skins a bit unnecessary, I'm content with the selection of free options available.

Speaking of pizza, I like mine with a bit of pineapple on top. I'm crazy like that.

The game is definitely F2P-friendly, as you can earn both of the two in-game currencies and coins used to draw eggs from the claw machine or purchase straight from the shop to get most of the character skins just by playing and leveling up. The rest are achievement rewards. The skins are all just cosmetics and don't affect the gameplay itself, so you can still win using any basic character without the clothes.

Some other bad reviews are about being unable to play offline and local multiplayer (shared/split-screen) issues, so if you are just planning to play online co-op and PvP, give it a shot.

That being said, the game itself is fantastic. I would definitely recommend playing with friends, but the physics system just creates an abundance of hilarious moments. Weapons are well designed, most maps have a unique gimmick, some of these can be very fun to work around while trying to knock each other out of an arena. Most importantly, the game breathes polish, it has been very well made with a stylistic art style that looks gorgeous.

Naturally some of the maps are more fun than others, myself preferring the brawl knock-out style game modes to the sport based ones for example, but there is a voting system that can be used before each game that tends to avoid the less popular maps.

Common complaints are about the micro transactions but you earn enough money in game to buy a few without having to spend anything, plus they are all cosmetics. I also don't understand all the complaints about no offline mode when this has been a trend for years now.

My only issues are that achievements are really ridiculous and have cosmetic unlocks behind them, they can only be done in quick matches and are insanely hard. I also hope they have a content roadmap planned as while there are a decent amount of maps right now, these kind of games live and die by how much content they release.

- Adorable aesthetic, with hilarious animations and just a really solid, polished look throughout.
- Decently accessible control scheme.

Con's:
- Online connection is required even for local play. They have been pitching it this entire time on the premise of ""play online or offline,"" and only walked that promise back after people bought it and it became clear that the devs were lying. Tried to play with friends at a party at my house, and there were numerous additional steps to make it a ""private"" server even with all of us on one machine. And, of course, an online connection was required. Took the wind out of our sails almost instantly.
- Because they discreetly built this whole game around the online component, the ""shared screen"" multiplayer that makes Gang Beasts so easy to pick up and play is gone here. Every player gets their own tiny split screen, which is honestly just absurd for a game of this nature and scale. Each of us struggling to make out details on 1/4th of the screen space we would otherwise have, on an arena that's so small that we're basically all looking at a tiny version of the exact same thing from slightly different angles. Not at all worth the trade-off for camera control in a game where we shouldn't even be thinking about the camera.

I was excited at the prospect of being able to play this game online when local play wasn't an option, but to see that online  has completely dominated the design philosophy of this game is a massive downer.

    This game is fire. If you like Gang Beasts you should totally get this. Even if you don't like gang beasts or know what Gang Beasts is, you should get this. A lot of people are complaining about microtransactions, but they aren’t that bad. Yes, you can buy currency, but you can also earn it in the free “battle pass” like system. Sometimes items in the shop will cost actual money, but like just don’t buy them. You can get plenty of skins by just playing. And don’t act like you wouldn’t want to make money if it was your game. Input latency doesn’t even exist (for me at least). The only problem is no offline play, but multiplayer is super fun. And I’m sure offline play will be added in the future. I played for 7 hours straight and didn’t get bored. 10/10",1695608888,1695608927,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198297599685,0,10,1190,5,437,1706047342

I also see complaints about the price of the items in the store and while I agree that the prices are high, there are plenty of challenges, achievements and ways to earn in-game currency without spending any real money. 

With 20 maps at launch and multiple different modes, I feel $20 is about right on par with the amount of content that it offers.

146974403,english,"Got this to play with friends because it seemed like a fun little party game and boy is it poorly made with terrible inconsistency.

Players who play on MKB have an advantage to those who play with controllers. Can pickup and throw you right away while on controller you have to wait for input lag to grab things. You get knocked out for longer than others with no chance to recover or come back. Sometimes even one hit KOs right at the start of the match with just one punch and not a weapon. Some weapons can KO you with one hit as well, the shovel seems the one that can do it the most often. 

At times you can be the last one standing but the win is awarded to another team. Groups of 4 will team up and win trade rounds and gang up on solo teams. Too many AFKs that are replaced with an AI bot that just stands around and does nothing. 

Terrible network connections that cause lag throughout the whole match and will drop you out of the match. Oh and you will end up with a leaver queue as if this game is ranked.

146973553,english,"[h1] You must be curious why this game has so many negative reviews in Chinese. [/h1]
For English speakers:
If you know what this game has done in China, you will know why Chinese players give so many negative reviews to a game produced by a Chinese studio.
They had released a demo three years ago, when the epidemic was in lockdown and everyone was at home with nothing to do. If they had released the game then, it would have been a monumental achievement in the history of gaming, probably on par with 2016's Overwatch. But they didn't, insisting that the game needed more processing, which took almost four years. The pandemic is over, and naturally people don’t have time to play party games. 
This is actually not the point. I just want to complain a bit as a player who has waited for so long. [h3] The real point begins here. [/h3]
Before the game was finally released, the producers made it clear in interviews that their nitpicks resulted in the game being too expensive to run, and [u] they were not shy about making it clear that they were prepared to make players pay for the company's operational missteps. [/u] [b] However, there doesn’t seem to be much problem with the price in Europe or the United States? [/b] 
We all know that games on Steam are priced differently in different countries, which usually depends on economic conditions and exchange rates. The same type of party games are often priced [b] half [/b] as much in China as in the United States, while Party Animals are almost the [b ]same [/b] price as in the United States. To refer back to the previous paragraph, [u] they were not shy about making it clear that they were prepared to make players pay for the company's operational missteps. [/u]  [h3] So, let’s guess which players bear this cost? [/h3]
[b] Any promotions and announcements from the studio based in English are a mask of hypocrisy as they have never released the same content in Chinese, [/b] even though this is a Chinese studio. Their attitude towards Chinese players is ignorance and arrogance. [u] Some people posted videos on China's YouTube (some of you may have heard of it, namely bilibili) exposing the company's different treatment of English users and Chinese players. However, these videos were subsequently reported and deleted by the company, and any negative comments and questions raised by the player community have also been blocked and deleted without an official reply. [/u]
[b] Finally, I'll talk about what's really about the game itself. [/b] After almost four years of work, what's the difference between a game and a demo? I don't know how many of you have played that demo, but the answer is, [b] almost nothing, [/b] except for some paid skins and raffle boxes.
In addition, in China, the in-game currency was officially designated as ""ni mo bi"". If translated into English, it would be, "" [spoiler] phack u coin/dollar [/spoiler] "", just read it out. [strike] Could this be an unintentional mistake? [/strike]
Yes, this has nothing to do with any non-Chinese people. I just want to show that our anger is not unfounded. [h2] Chinese player have indeed suffered unfair treatment from a Chinese company. [/h2] How ironic! But if you still can’t understand the reason for so many bad reviews based on Chinese, then I can only wish you good luck.",1695602104,1695607222,TRUE,1727,122,0.8648992180824279,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198323357675,0,5,11,0,11,1695600783

I personally think it is best to start playing with a friend if possible, so you can learn together. I also recommend watching videos by ""@ScoobyYTT"" on YouTube for tips when you are starting, or when you just need some extra help. In conclusion, party animals is a pretty good game.

146968953,english,"Game is fun, but I won't recommend it in its current state:

- There's no offline mode. Why does a party game need to be online-only other than trying to sell expensive skins? Speaking of which...
- Extremely predatory mtxs. There's a skin that literally costs more than the game itself.
- Some modes are just extremely unfair (having an ice gun in the fighter jet level, giving whoever can grab it a huge advantage, as anyone who gets shot are automatically eliminated).
- You get a 1-2 minute ban from Quick Play if you quit, which is dumb for a non-competitive party game. Why should I stay in the game when my team has been eliminated on the last round? This is Gang Beasts with animals, not Halo. Nobody is taking this game that seriously, nor should they.
- This is just my experience, but playing solo is a pain. I couldn't win a single round due to having crappy teammates more than half the time.
- Even though chances of winning are low, if you happen to be in a huge losing streak, you'll still have the same player level, as this game seems to only reward XP for wins. Even Fall Guys lets you progress without winning.

I was just punished for quitting early, even though my game was frozen in the stage select screen.

I love this game so much. I've had fun playing with some friends and its just all around a fun and friendly competition type of game. Physics are awesome. The UI and designs of the game are beautiful. Maps are well thought out. 

The only critique I have is that when I've tried redeeming codes, I get network errors constantly and have to try like 5-6 times before it registers and when I search for custom games or people, the search can take up to a minute of trying to find something.

interactive spectator mode!!!!!

servers have had no issues for me
the style is amazing, game play is fun.

Now for the people who are complaining about micro-transactions. Its incredibly surprising this game has mixed reviews because of it! They have a free battle pass that gives you a generous amount of nova bucks (money currency). You can earn skins, bucks, and cookies (non money currency) through achievements. The skins are nowhere near as expensive as people are making it seem. ($20 skin??? Most nova bucks skin i see are less than $10 worth about 600-800 nova bucks, but it depends on the rarity.) 

You get 200 - 400 nova bucks every like 5 levels in the pass.

They also have legendary skins for the in game currency cookies!!! 
They are selling their Ori and the Blind Forest skins for cookies and that's a crossover promotion skin, NO GAMES DO THAT.

10 Hour Later Update:

Party Animals is [i]still[/i] a very fun game marred by idiotic and questionable design choices. 

[h2]The Good[/h2]
[list]
[*]Fun gameplay and physics, some fun levels.  Good times fighting friends [i]online[/i].  You'll for sure get a laugh out of it.
[*]Lot's of characters to choose from.  Many are unlocked by achievements, though some can be very frustrating, it's nice that they are there.   
[*]Graphics are very good.  The aesthetics of the game are great.
[/list]

[h2]Middle of the Road[/h2]
[list]
[*]Limited time skins.  Nice they are having some crossovers with other games (like Ori and the Blind Forest) but annoying that they are limited time events praying on your FOMO.  These skins are also SUPER expensive and nearly impossible to get both unless you play religiously.
[/list]

[h2]The Bad[/h2]
[list]
[*]Microtransactions (or should I say macro at this point?).  One legendary skin costs more than the entire game.  Loot box's are in the form of eggs you open.  Sounds like you can get duplicates.  There's something that resembles a seasonal battle pass that's free, I'd expect that to change in the future.  It has everything a scummy F2P mobile game would, but with a price tag of $20 on top of it.  Seems predatory towards kids, and I don't like that.  (I'm aware it's all cosmetic, but releasing a paid game with MTX skins day one is a negative mark from me.  Anything developed pre-release should just be available to earn via playing day one.  Monetize your game later all you want, so long as its a fair priced model.)
[*]No offline mode.  Presumable ripped out to keep people online and wanting to spend money on their MTX's.  Changing the game description after the fact is also scummy.  I do have a steam deck, and guess I'll never get to play this one on the go.  Anyone defending this is simping.
[*]Local play is a mess.  You cannot customize each controller to each players desired preferences.  If I want my Y-axis inverted and the other player doesn't, tough luck.  The game also letterbox's the screen (black bars top and bottom), so you lose a good portion of your usable screen and get stuffed into tiny screens of your own.  Games like Human Fall Flat don't do this, why does Party Animals need to?  (update:  work around to controls is playing via two PC's on Steam Remote Play, and having the second player map their controls through big picture.  You also have to drag and drop controllers to other slots via the steam overlay as remote host to get them to register.  JANK).
[*]Quite a few levels are super lack luster and boring.  Not enough levels for it to not get stale after a relatively short amount of time.  
[*]Party and UI system kinda sucks.  No options to choose if you want to quick-join into a 2v2v2v2 or a 4v4.  I prefer the fighting, not interested in janky soccer.
[*]Matchmaking bans if you leave a game you don't want to play.  Nobody is taking this game that seriously, especially when you're forcing quick-join on us and not letting us set some parameters of what we want to play.
[/list]

Mostly just a quick summary of my initial thoughts.  I think the developers should re-visit local play, as well as offline if this is indeed supposed to be a party game.  I already know nothing will be done about their macrotransactions as whales are sure to keep spending.  Game will need more levels ASAP or people will definitely start getting bored.  

If all the things I listed above don't sound like they'd bother you, then maybe you'd enjoy Party Animals.  It can be fun and hilarious, but as of right now the cons outweigh the pros.

After three years of development, there is nothing new apart from a few maps and the ridiculous random-ass throwing mini-game after death, which absolutely ruins the game and adds another random element to the already random fights.

I believe the physics have gotten a LOT worse since the beta. I do not remember experiencing such randomness back then. The game does really poor job in registering hits and the sheer nonsense of how long you get knocked for is absolutely mind-boggling. I Usually, get knocked out for 6+ seconds, while the others get knocked out for barely 2 seconds. It has also happened to me several times that  I have been killed by a single hit right at the start of a match, how ridiculous is that?

The complains generally point out the in-game shop for premium skins, even though it is a quite costly game!
If you don't want them, don't buy them. That easy.
There is a leveling system with different rewards, like skins and currency (for skins), and achievements to give you even more skins. 
No Pay-To-Win system at all, only cosmetics!

Gameplaywise I'm having a blast and laughing at all the shenanigans happening in the game, like someone knocking himself out with his own nunchuck xD
There are several new maps and many different team-based 4v4 arcade modes, that were not available in the beta.
Another new feature for spectators are throwable items, so that you can still annoy players from beyond the grave.

Few additional notes:
- Can queue up as up to 4 players (max players per map are 8. so 4v4 or 4 teams of 2) -> haven't tried out as 3, but you'll probably get a random in your team
- You have to choose unique players names and there have been many instances, where I would get matched with players with racial slurs in their names. So far there is no option to report them.
- Games can get pretty onesided, if one team knows what it's doing and the other don't. Not suggesting a rank system, but it can get frustrating for easily tilted players. If you can't take an L in a fun game, then this might not be for you.

146944482,english,"Okay so I love love LOVE this game. I’ve been waiting for it’s release since the demo in 2020, so the new maps were a welcome addition to what i was already pining for. The game is less expensive than I thought it would be, so the shop doesn’t bother me. All of the costumes and animals are super adorable, and the chaos is super fun and funny. The fast paced nature also makes it easy to recover from a loss, and I personally feel like the array of maps now gives gamers of differing strengths their ‘time to shine’ so to speak (ex: someone more strategy oriented can have advantage in certain modes against those more combat oriented). Having been so focused on this game for 3 years, I was inwardly pretty defensive about all of the bad reviews on release day, but now that I’ve had time to process I have some more thoughts. I’m not gonna focus on the ones that I don’t personally have an issue with (I play most games online solo, and again, the shop just doesn’t bother me) but more so ones not brought up:

For starters, friendly fire is a big issue. You can turn it off for custom games, but not QP. If you’re a little spacey like me, it’s not always easiest to tell who is on your team when everyone is in a frenzy and the colors are a blur. I’ve knocked a few people out purely by accident, and then I can’t even send a message in game apologizing or explaining myself. There are also leave penalties, which are understandable, but if your teammate accidentally knocks you out (or purposely because you wouldn’t know), of course you’re going to be mad and want to quit! Furthermore, sometimes the AI replacements are seemingly OP, and I’m suspicious that the matchmaking algorithm isn’t quite right yet. 
Continuing on, in last stand, sometimes (often enough to be a problem) the game glitches and awards the win to the second place player instead. It’s absolutely infuriating to see every other player go down and then have the star go to someone else, and if it happens to you, it often just feels sleazy, cause you know you didn’t deserve it. 
Then there are the spectator items. When you knock someone out with one, it’s AMAZING but when someone knocks you out, it’s rage inducing. There is no way to really dodge these, and it’s very easy to bean someone with pure luck, which means that even if you’re the best player on the team, you could potentially consistently lose just due to spectator items. There’s no way to turn them off in custom or otherwise, and they have consistently ruined a great game for me. 
Lastly, there is the server issue. This doesn’t personally affect me, but I felt like it was worth mentioning regardless, as it’s a BIG mess up. There are no Australian servers. If you are in AUS, you will have to connect to Asian servers, and the ping is just atrocious. If I was an Aussie buyer, I’d be pretty peeved. 

To sum it all up: I think this game is absolutely worth it, especially at $20 (unless of course you’re from down under). There are definitely hours of fun to be had, and the AI is pretty decent in custom games, so you can enjoy on your own, with friends, or with strangers. The designs are cute and fun and the game modes are delightful, especially so to someone who played the demo and expected just that. Like any new game, there are issues, and I would appreciate them being fixed, but in my experience, they’re minimal enough that I would continue to play in any case.

146917035,english,"Party Animals is an addictingly fun arena brawler with incredibly cute and fuzzy animals, each level has its own unique gimmick and each round feel reasonably short & sweet. 

You can que with up to 3 friends for Quickmatch where you can vote on 1 of 3 levels to play which can either be the last stand type levels, where all players are divided into teams of 2 for a first to 3 survival where you try to be the last man standing, hope is not lost if you're eliminated as you can throw in various objects into the field which can either save your duo partner from elimination or secure the round for someone else in a very comedic effect. Alternatively you can also vote to play any of the 4v4 team maps where you need to work together as a team to score points and win.

If just playing random maps with other players isn't your forte, then you can always host your own Custom-Games where you can play against bots and customize the game rules to your heart's content, if you only want to play privately with friends then this mode is for you. You even have access to play a pair of Fight Club levels where your teams objective is to pumble and yeet your opponents off the safe areas of maps until the other team runs out of lives.

As far as balance goes some items can feel incredible oppressive and difficult to work against, unless you can time your punches and jump kicks right you might end up having someone smack you with a shovel until you're knocked out for good or comically yeeted off the stage, while other items like the freeze and stun-guns can feel incredibly oppressive to fight against at times, if nobody who's already eliminated knocks down the gun standing player that has someone in an indefinite stunlock, it can very easily feel like you're not allowed to play the game when someone is perfectly positioned to constantly hit you with the stun-gun with every shot...

146909441,english,"(at the time of making this review 9/24) I'm very neutral about this game. its not bad, but I've played better rag-doll fighters, the problem is, some maps when you get knocked out of the ring the climbing is inconstant, you'll sometimes get out on the first try and sometimes you won't. but sometimes when you do, theirs someone waiting for you to knock you back down. Someone has a two handed weapon? don't try to get near them unless other people are. weapons don't break so they can keep spamming them unless its the nun chucks then there's a chance that they'll knock themselves out but it doesn't happen often, and when it does your already dead. So far there is no queue for certain game modes or teams, so you have to get lucky that 1 outta 3 maps are the one you wanna play. most of the half of the modes are 4 teams of 2, so maps feel really cramped at times. if they added an option for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 then you wouldn't have three other teams to worry about. this game is just at the name says PARTY animals, it's still fun to play, but it really shines when you play with friends where as quick play, it's just yourself unless you get a friend. When you're by yourself you can get a rageful teammate who tries to knock you out when you accidentally knock them out because most people don't communicate with each other, and it's very annoying/ difficult to see who your teammate is because they will have their small name as your team color, it would be nice if they had an outline or showed who your teammate is when selecting the animal so you know what they look like. this game has only been out for less than a week so everything i said will/ might change and so will my opinion about this game, I might like it more, I might like it less. If you are thinking of buying it go ahead but play with friends for the time being. If you don't have any friends then i recommend waiting, making friends, or playing custom games. 6/10 because with friends it's fun.",1695532802,1695532802,TRUE,1,0,0.5238095521926879,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198079494660,0,8,350,0,278,1696920051

146905703,english,"[h1]If you were thinking about picking up Party Animals for couch-coop play, unfortunately I have to just recommend you look elsewhere. The local play is just flat out bad. Gang beasts got this right six years ago, and it's sad that this game can't do the same.[/h1]

In couch coop play, you are forced to create a lobby on the internet, so if your internet is bad, or you're on the go, for instance (Steam Deck :) you're shit outta luck, you basically cannot play. But let's say, you do have a decent internet connection, there's still a glaring issue. For the main gamemode, last man standing, every player is forced into using a quadrant (1/4) of the screen to play, which means if you're sitting a reasonable distance from the screen, in a four player match, you will not be able to tell what's going on half the time. This problem does not fix itself even when playing with two players, as the screens are divided into the small boxes instead of a split horizontally or vertically. Though I think the only thing that could fix this problem, is scrapping the different views for all four players, and consolidating it into one, big view, where the camera dynamically shifts to where players are positioned in the map. And you can still have the spectators throwing items, just have their cursors be a different color to differentiate and put a lil icon of the currently selected item, plus a little bar with slices in it to be the 'coins.' I can understand the split perspectives for team modes, though maybe just consider having one per team, to reduce screen clutter.

All these problems make me really sad, because this game, I truly believe has the potential to far surpass the amount of fun and chaos you can have in something like Gang Beasts. This game has the potential to be the absolute highlight of any party game session, and leave everyone feeling like they had fun. I know this because even just playing the matchmaking that's in the game with random people, I had a blast, and I know it'd be far more enjoyable with my friends. But with that, all the issues the game has just makes it a flat out bad party game, and right now, I don't think it's deserving of the title ""Party"" Animals. Because right now, the best way to play this game is on a screen of your own, and if you wanted that true party experience, you'd have to setup a lan party.

If any developers are reading this, know that I love Party Animals, you have all made such an amazing and charming game, with some brilliant gameplay and maps. I think if you changed the way you handle the local coop, your game could be the headlining party game of all my, and many others, parties.",1695526870,1695527223,FALSE,2,2,0.5126497745513916,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198276484446,201,5,786,36,487,1706319618

146900112,english,"First and foremost: you have to be online to play this game. This sucks. Devs please make an offline mode. Im recommending this game for now but if this doesn't change I will change this recommendation in the future.

As for the game, its ""oh crap the kids need to go to bed because we lost track of time, played 3 hours straight, and now its an hour past their bedtime"" fun. Seriously, my kids and I had a blast playing and we are looking forward to playing tomorrow.

You DO NOT need to play with random internet strangers. You can, but you can just as easily go to Custom Game, make the lobby private, have the other players press RT on their controller, and now you've got ""connected to internet but local only"" couch game. Even better? Get a friend with a computer, have them load up 4 players, join your private lobby, and now you have 8 player mayhem.

There are 3 categories of game modes, and so far none feel gimmicky. FYI I have not tried all the maps for each category. There is the classic - beat up the other teams, throw them off, knock out mode with 9 maps. Each map we have tried (maybe 6 out 9 so far) has been a different experience and brought new obstacles to the mode. 

The next category is team/score based. There are several different maps, we have only tried 4 and each mode has been a blast. There is soccer and football mode: and i really thought this would be a gimmicky mode but nah, it was actually fun. Nothing like playing soccer, running to the ball, jumping and drop kicking the ball halfway across the map while you knock out an opposing team member. Blissful. My kids and I spent like 20 minutes in each mode. 

There was another really cool mode: parallel coal powered trains. Each team has to throw coal into the steam engine to make it speed up. The train that speeds ahead the furthest wins. Sounds kind of interesting, maybe some opportunity for teamwork, but wait... you can hop to the enemy train! You can smack them around, pull the brake and really cause mayhem to help your team. Or you could hit a sign along the train track jumping to the enemy train and get hit with a 10 second respawn timer.

There was another mode my kids and I tried on a whim, again, thinking it was going to be a gimmicky mode to fluff out the game but nope! It was some sort of capture the flag game except the flag was a safe tied to a air balloon floating in the middle of the map. And you have to jump grab and hobble back to your base to score. It took us a couple minutes to figure out how to move the flag around but once we did, it was a blast.

In arcade category, there are two maps with one being called ""final destination."" We tried that and to our surprise it is two teams of up to 4 each in a subway station fighting it out with 10 lives for each team. Some weapons can take out enemy teammates but the main method to reduce the enemy life bar is to knock them out, throw them on the subway track, and have them run over. The only problem is subways run every 15 seconds or so and you can get back up. This leads to mayhem, confusion, sacrifices to take down the other team.

I do want to point out there is the ability to pay real money for cosmetic stuff, but it hasnt been overly obnoxious in your face. Its there, at the bottom of the screen. We did unlock a token after about an hour of play that let us unlock a new character, which was cool. It sucks that it is kind of pay walled. You could grind to get currency or meet some objective to unlock a coin to get a new character, but its not designed to make the grind feel rewarding, like new skins every 1/2 or so of gameplay.

Overall, this is gang beasts mechanics with tons of different modes added to make it really stand out as its own game. It requires you to be connected to the internet, which is kind of a bummer. No true offline couch coop allowed (as of writing this review). Even though its a paid game, you will find that getting new skins is a grind that isn't rewarding and using real money is the quickest.",1695519206,1695519206,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198020418051,0,3,678,0,186,1700368435

146896697,english,"This game has a few grievances with it that are all completely valid: No offline mode despite the wording originally saying there was (the dev team even doubling down that it was essentially a reading error (they were right, you were wrong) due to English not being their first language), and the monetisation model for the game.

Again, neither of these are invalid complaints.

Just because Fall Guys got away with it when it was a paid game, doesn't make it okay. The multitude of different currencies are akin to mobile games made solely to trick people into spending money (including ridiculously bad conversion rates). This is bad business practice, players want ONE kind of currency from a paid game, no bullshit.

Despite these grievances - the game is good for what it is. It's a solid foundation for a genuinely fun party game.

- The hitboxes are janky, but that almost works in its favour as if they were too defined, the game may become too sweaty.
- The AI players are less than useless, in team-based game modes they essentially just run at the objective and are made to be fodder. In elimination modes, they don't even fight back, or just end themselves like Amazon package drones that realised they're not being paid.
- The report system is pretty lackluster considering the profanity filter is *too* good, including the blocking of ""God."" I can't believe how many times I've heard slurs be yelled in a party game about fluffy animals being sucked into a black hole.
- The servers and matchmaking suck, like, Multiversus tier suck. If you try to punch someone that you got matched with that's in Mexico, playing on their stolen Xbox, that punch isn't going through. In fact - you've already been punched one thousand times and they've won three times before you even realised you're dead.
- No filters for certain maps. I don't want to play team-based modes with Jimmy Jr. (4) that's on his dad's Steam Deck in the basement with one bar of wifi that feels nothing but the urge to run at the ball, or grab anything that moves. I don't want that.
- The music is awful. Seriously.

It's something that you can classify as a masterpiece of the game

(Here's a bit about the game)
It is hilariously fun
It's something you can do really quick
So you don't have to take a long time to like wait for a battle
Or like if you're in the middle of break at work
You can just pick it up, connect to something Play a round
And you had your fun

Those game has something similar to Fortnite in the sense of the little in-game shop
You can earn the paid cash through leveling up
So even if you don't want to spend money
You can stay your free to play player

All the adorable things are so adorable xD
Aka the characters the levels
It's just really amazing and has an intricate design
You can climb almost anything
There's different game modes that will come at you
Some are hard at first
But easy to master

And I guarantee you will laugh in this game because it is so funny

This game also has a in-game push to talk
And you can also just leave your mic on
So you can communicate and basically joke around with others

(Also side note if you still are dissuaded by the fact that it has so many negative reviews)

It is ridiculous the amount of down voting this game has
From people that misunderstood the developers' intentions

They compliment the gameplay
They compliment the fact that it's really interesting and amazing of a game
And they proceed to Leave a negative review
Just because there's no offline play
So they're disregarding basically the effort and intentions of everyone that was making this game
Just because of a misunderstanding

Don't let that the negative reviews dissuade you from buying this game
It's worth the price and more

Laughter Galore: The game does a fantastic job of creating spontaneous moments of hilarity. Throughout our session, there was hardly a moment where someone wasn't erupting into laughter or cheering. The sheer amount of joy this game has brought into our session is a testament to its brilliance.

Controversies and Misunderstandings: I've noticed that there has been some contention regarding the game's offline capabilities, which has unfortunately led to mixed reviews. To address the elephant in the room, I'd like to point out that party games, by design, thrive on interaction. Thus, the idea of playing such a game offline seems counterintuitive. Though the developers might have hinted at offline capabilities, it wasn't showcased in any of the playtests I'm aware of. It’s essential to evaluate a game by its strengths, and this game shines when played with others, be it online or offline.

Setting the Record Straight: Party games are fundamentally about togetherness and creating memorable moments. They aren't solitary experiences. Whether you're snuggled up on a couch with friends or connecting through an online platform, the essence remains the same – fun-filled interactions. I genuinely believe that many who gave this game a negative review may have missed the point entirely.

Verdict: Party Animals delivers an outstanding party gaming experience that should be celebrated and recognized. The essence of a party game is its ability to bring joy, laughter, and moments of pure fun, and this game does all that and more in spades.

146868898,english,"[READ] - Unbiased and FACTS worth of a review + Important pros and cons 

At first glance after reading the comments and seeing the spam of negative reviews I was hesitant at first However...




Do not let the negative comments fool you however I will mention some pros and cons with the game.

The game is very fun with friends as well some interesting maps and is overly quite fun and enjoyable. Considering this is the developers first game at making something they have done well to be honest as well as do some mini updates here and there. 

Micro transactions - I am not sure why people are complaining as its completely optional. You can get all the rewards just by playing the game normally anyway. And tbh every game has micro transactions noways and I didn't pay $50 for it and its not a triple A game so do what you want with your money either spend it on the outfits or don't they don't force it in your face really. If anything its hidden to the sides of the screen tbh.

However the skins are a bit on the heavier side in terms of micro transactions if you don't want to grind normally as well as some other skins too. However i don't really see this as too much as a con as skins are not really needed and are cosmetic anyway people who are complaining can just NOT SPEND anything so I don't see the huge deal. There are a few that are high priced but then again ITS OPTIONAL so. again shouldn't be a huge problem however I do feel like they can be adjusted 

Servers - 
Considering the game came out literally 3 days ago I think that is has so far is great. However you may need a fast internet connection and depending on your location will depend on your latency which is not too bad unless you are from Australia right now they are not really using any servers that can be used by your region but they already stated that they are keeping limits on the game ATM. Accessible to XBOX and PC because they are a recently new dev company and its their first game so they want to get it right.

Can I play with friends? - 
Yes you can play private matches with friends. However when you click quick play it just shoves you into a random game however I do wish there was a mode to pick which ones (via quick play) you can with custom servers and find the game mode you want there but in quick play you cannot.


Can you play in private servers alone? without going into public lobbies -
 Yes you can you just launch a custom game and off you go. Invite some friends or add some AI. You do get a bit less XP for playing with ALL AI but that goes with all games tbh.

Is this game actually fun? -
Depending on your idea of fun. If you like playing with friends and knocking them out and tossing them all over the place while landing a bomb next to another freind and send them flying off bridges then yeah its a good laugh yeah.

However I suggest YOU the CONSUMER take it upon yourself to play the game and give a review yourself at first I thought I wouldn't enjoy it but with due respect most are being karens and making a big deal because other people are doing it and just following the negative review chain. 

Take it apon yourself to play the game however from personal experience me and my friends love it and makes a good random party game.

Hope this review cleared some air. Feel free to upvote dislike it whatever you feel. This is just here for other people to see.


So overall its a new game, It has its flaws atm but that's expected as its recently released not to long ago. In terms of the server issues with ""Australia"" and I hope they add more features in terms of accessibility to pick what modes to use in quick play.

TLDR: 
Pros

- Good game with friends
- Rag doll physics are just hilarious
- Interesting maps and hopefully they add new ones
- Play it for yourself and give it a shot (if your willing to spend £15 - $20 ish dollers? i think)
- Headbutted people off the arcade machines and out a window 10/10 and makes for some funny moments.

Cons
- Australia currently get it the worst for servers atm
- You may need a solid internet connection to have the best experience and pray you are closest to your server 
- Defiantly room for more improvements but I think their main focus will be seeing how this game plays out before they expand further (they already mentioned that on the forms)

First of, I will start saying that the game itself is extremely good and very polished. You can feel the developers drive to make this game entertaining, fun, customizable and full of replayability. They managed to do well in all of these categories for me which makes the game extremely good for me.

The bad things now... 

It's local play is limited, and there is no Offiline mode. You can only play with one friend in one PC/Console and it HAS to be in a custom game for some reason. The Splitscreen is also weird placed on PC which are just two small blocks. They could've easily made it at least 4 players per PC by the size of the screen.

You are limited to certain server regions (for now) and that can be a deal breaker because of lag. If they plan to add more servers in the future, I can easily say that I might commit more hours into this game.",1695483481,1695483481,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198112879039,55,2,1721,193,301,1707001747

This game is hands down one of the best Launches of 2023 its gang beasts 2.0 and it is worth the wait honestly support the devs cause if you look into the settings you will find that they shout out there QA Testers and there are alot of them this is one of the most solid games ever i remember that everyone was saying this game will never come out that was never true the devs were making sure that the quality of this game is amazing also there is a free lvl pass so you can unlock skins icons emotes and premium currency just by playing the game honestly people will complain about the smallest monitization dont listen to the complaints about this game cause it is still hands down really solid

146846989,english,"It's disheartening to witness this game receiving mixed reviews, but I believe there's more to it than meets the eye. Despite initial confusion regarding the offline mode and the in-game shop, I've found myself thoroughly enjoying this title. The game boasts a charming roster characters that adds to its appeal.

Now, let's address the issue of expensive skins. While the pricing model could use some adjustment, the good news is that purchasing them is entirely optional. I do encourage providing feedback on the pricing structure, as it's an important aspect of the game's future. Personally, I'm holding off on acquiring skins at their current prices, but it hasn't left me feeling frustrated. I'm hopeful that the developers might introduce skin sales or include them in a capsule machine rotation down the line. Additionally, it's worth noting that the game offers a leveling system that rewards you with Cookies and Nemo Bucks (the premium currency) as you progress.

My primary concern, however, revolves around the voice chat feature. Frankly, I wish it didn't exist. While it can be disabled, I've encountered instances of harassment, particularly as a woman player. Unfortunately, the system for reporting voice chat harassment is somewhat lacking, with the only option being to send logs through text chat. Given that the game is accessible to children as well, this aspect makes me uncomfortable. I hope they address this otherwise I'll just keep disabling it. 

Setting aside these concerns, I've personally waited a long time for its release, and I'm pleased to say that I haven't experienced any server issues so far. and I've been enjoying the 3rd day of this game.

146840554,english,"i seriously don't understand all the hate for this game.

as a person with already 15 hours on the game despite it being released 3 days ago, i'll give you the honest truth. but first i'll inform you of the stuff you need to be aware of.

1. cookies and nemo bucks
nemo bucks are considered the ""premium currency"", you get 200 nemo bucks every two levels in the ""battle pass"". cookies are a much more common thing to get. if i remember correctly, you get 1500 cookies every other level. so essentially it goes like this:

1500 cookies
reward
1500 cookies
200 nemo bucks
and so on.

however, at least for me, it takes a little while to level up. although that really depends how good you are at the game.

2. ""battle pass"" (i forgot the name of it)
the ""battle pass"" (as of now) is completely free and accessible to everyone. in the battlepass, you can earn avatars, outfits, characters and more. the more common things you'll be getting are egg coins, cookies, and nemo bucks. as i've stated before it can be a little while to level up often, unless you're an absolute monster at the game.

3. egg coins
so, theres essentially a gacha system in the game. 1 roll costs 120 nemo bucks, and 10 rolls costs 1200 nemo bucks. it's incredibly rare to get a legendary, as i've only got one in all 15 hours of my gameplay as of writing this.
IT'S ONLY A GAMBLING SYSTEM IF YOU LET IT BE

4. misunderstanding about offline gameplay.
this was already addressed by the developers, but in case you don't know what happened, i'll explain briefly here.
so, in the games description it says something along the lines of ""offline and online gameplay"". people from my understanding thought that would mean single player?? which really doesn't make sense. or for whatever reason thought that you wouldn't need internet to play the game? i really don't know. but, there is TECHNICALLY a ""single player"" mode. there are things called custom matches, in these custom matches, you can make one yourself and add as many AI you want in the lobby. there are different difficulties you can edit for each bot. in these custom matches you can also choose the gamemode, map, how much health/stamina you have, etc. people also have public matches making it so you can play with friends with your own rules.

5. matchmaking, gamemodes, and maps.
i never had an issue with matchmaking. it's quick, simple, and easy. all you do is: press quick match, press the green button below ""+ invite friends"". and then you are all ready matchmaking. after that, you will get put into a lobby where the lobby will then vote on a map. each map has a different game mode. for example, there's beast soccer, and ice breaker. ice breaker is a 2v2v2v2. while beast soccer is 4v4, making it 8 people per lobby. i will state what maps i remember are 2v2v2v2 and 4v4 below.

**2v2v2v2 maps**
ice breaker
broken arrow
wind map (i forgot the name)
winter is coming
(and some poison cloud map i forgot the name of)

**4v4 maps**
beast soccer
beast football
beast hockey
buzz ball
lollipop factory
stay afloat


i've given all the information i could remember. if i miss anything i needed to address, i apologize.
================================================================================================
common issues people have with the game

1. microtransactions.
people complain about the ""premium currency"" (nemo bucks) being too pricey, even being more expensive than the game. while this is true, you (at least for now) can get the ""premium currency"" for completely free. the ""battle pass"", if you will, is ENTIRELY free and therefore you get the nemo bucks for free. i will let you know though it takes a little bit of time and saving.

2. gacha system
i personally don't see the problem with this. yes, it is a gambling system as is every gacha system, and yes, it is rare to get something you like. although, it's up to your decision whether to do it or not. gacha system from what ive seen also can be waited to be purchased from the store or even sometimes purchased from the character itself with ingame currency (cookies). the ingame currency being cookies. for reference in the item shop, the ""epic"" characters in the item shop are 3000 nemo bucks if i remember correctly. while the gacha rolling is 120 nemo bucks for one roll, and 1200 for 10 rolls. although one small complaint i have is that you get only half of the amount of the outfit (it's also transferred into cookies, so you wont be getting nemo bucks from duplicates :C) when you get a duplicate, but that's just me being greedy.

3. matchmaking
i saw someone complaining how you get in a lobby with complete strangers. and i don't really understand because that's like complaining how fortnite is online. and plus, it's not necessary to play with strangers. i've mentioned custom matches and AI before. although you will not get XP from custom matches i think.

4. monetization system
i will admit, the monetization is absolutely terrible. and i don't know for sure, but from what i've heard you can get temporarily banned for it. but also, keep in mind. this was made in shanghai. making english not their first language. so i understand why there are issues with monetization. there is also voice chat that from what i believe, is not monetized. you might get in trouble if you get reported for saying something derogatory. so, yeah. monetization is terrible and is really the only issue i have with the game.

5. advertising
i see where people are coming from with this. although, again like most of the issues. it isn't in your face until you click the item shop, or MAYBE your locker on some occasions. but, it's like how fortnite advertises. and nobody had a problem with fortnites advertisements, so i don't see why people are having issues with this games advertising. they have been already sponsored by star wars i believe, so that could be what they're talking about. i don't really understand what some of them are talking about, so i'm just running on what i think they are saying.

6. friending system
this.. is actually pathetic the amount of work the players don't want to do. all you need to do is click on your profile, click on your ID code, it automatically copies it to your clipboard, and paste it in some sort of chat you and your friends have. i hate to be harsh, but the negative reviews are mainly people being lazy and expecting the game to make it easy for them. friending isn't hard, also, so when you see people complaining about that, just keep in mind they have no idea what they're talking about.

i'm noticing this repeated theme of ""they make you work for currencies and characters"". and, if you have at least one wrinkle in your brain, you will understand WHY this exists. it's so people can stay invested. i saw someone say that they ""expect"" you to buy currency. this.. is entirely false. they do not EXPECT you to buy anything. you could work for it and get the currencies for **completely free.** it just takes a lot of work, which these people clearly don't like doing.

the two biggest complaints i'm seeing are the microtransactions and the offline mode, so i'll briefly sum that up here.

microtransactions, despite what everyone tells you, do not and will never (as of now) require you to spend IRL money on the game. the ""battle pass"" is entirely free (AS OF WRITING THIS) where you get said currencies from the ""battle pass""

offline mode was a misunderstood concept. i understand why people thought local matches would exist although even then you can easily friend them with a simple 2 clicks and a paste. i can't talk about split screen because i am on PC, so i'll leave that to the console players to talk about. i've heard that it's only a two person split screen, though.

sorry if this review missed anything or had any issues. this was wrote at 1:00 AM so i am a bit tired and might miss things. i won't be fixing it if you do point out issues, so keep that in mind. anyways, have a good day/night.",1695455986,1695579026,TRUE,11,2,0.536214769,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561199232621845,0,4,1554,12,1082,1706763383

[b]- Character Variety:[/b] The game boasts a variety of animal types, each with its unique and fun skins. (Seriously, check out the images and names!) The attention to detail is evident: not only are the visuals cute, but they are also well-executed. You can almost feel the fluffiness of the animal fur!

[b]- Game Modes:[/b] Dive into 3 distinct modes: ""Last Stand,"" ""Team Score,"" and ""Arcade."" These modes together span a whopping 20 maps, a lot of it with different mechanics. And contrary to some reviews, there's flexibility in starting a game; you can create or join a Custom Game Room with or without a password, without needing a full team of 8 players.

[b]- Monetization:[/b] Some negative reviews are due to monetization, but it's important to note that in-game purchases are solely for skins and do not affect gameplay at all. I fail to see any problem with this in this specific game, specially because they need to maintain a server and release updates.

[b]- Pricing:[/b] A minor setback for some might be the game's regional pricing. While there's some differentiation between regions, it could be more substantial. For those on a budget, the Game Pass option might be a much more appealing option.

146835109,english,"The game is fun, really fun. The fact that there is a skin that costs more than the game itself is just goofy. There is a gacha machine for skins that can be paid for with in game currency and real world money. It dampens the fun a little bit but is also easy to ignore. The game is pretty generous with the standard and premium currency in the free battle pass that serves as it's means of progression (there is no paid battle pass). When you start out you have a bunch of animals to pick from and the rest I have gotten from the battle pass and gacha pulls, multiple of which were rare. At this point I have almost every animal after one day of play. I've played games with similar monetization schemes that feel less than fair but I've gotten the opposite vibe from this game. Kinda feels like the publisher demanded it and the devs did it as fairly as they could.  Would still be nice to have a way to hide real world monetization somewhere in settings for all the kids that will inevitably play considering it is a paid game to begin with.

Requiring an internet connection is this games biggest fault. There is a local / AI mode but you still need to be connected to play. I imagine that this is an anti-piracy measure but really only proves to be anti-consumer. I don't have to worry about my connection much and only play online anyway, but it's still a huge caveat that can hopefully be addressed.

The game itself is very Gang Beasts-esque. There are a solid number of maps, some objective based, some last man standing. Random melee/ranged weapons spawn in and give matches a smash bro's vibe. Controls are simple and silly but not frustrating, you can definitely get gud, I can not.

Graphically, I think it's gorgeous. Solid blend of art style and fidelity without overdoing it. The physics shine in both interacting with the environment / items and combat. Running a 3080 / Ryzen 3900x I was at a mostly locked 144 at 1440p with everything cranked and DLSS off. It scales really well if your running older hardware / steam deck as well. It isn't hard to get a locked 60 while still turning up a few settings that matter to you, so long as FSR is on of course.

There's cute avatar's / frames / emotes and skins to collect in the battlepass and through getting in game achievements as well. It feels like your unlocking stuff every game.

Based off of the current state of the game industry I can definitely see the monetization getting worse, per the suits upstairs, but as of right now it doesn't feel AS egregious as it could thanks to the level of polish it currently has.

Here's my take, and watch it live @ShamloudTTV

The game is pretty good. It is worth the $20. It is fun with friends, it is fun by yourself. 
The game has great skins, some cool weaponry choices, and some decent map designs / game-modes. 
It has some weird quirks that make the game funny and intense, but it also has some draw backs aswell.
Before I say anything about the drawbacks, buy this game and enjoy it. Its fun, and worth it.

First they gotta chance the grab mechanic for controller. It doesn't work well without being to aim. On PC it is OP and you can easily beat most people once you get comfortable on keyboard/mouse just because you can toss them better. 
The keyboard/mouse is just overall more OP. It's kinda hard to explain. You can turn on a dime on kb/m which you can't on controller aswell.
The climb mechanic is hit or miss/rng style and I hate it. Needs to go. You think you should easily climb it but the hold to climb or press just doesn't work most the time and you fail at the climb.
Make the climbing both hands, and pull up body or something like Gang Beasts. 
Make the shovel less OP. I've been one tapped many times off spawn just by getting hit once. Instant dead.
Knockout timer feels random, wish there was a way to see maybe the time/or severity of your knockout
I'm in NA and why does the game always try to launch in South America servers? More than once I've had to switch. 
Seems to always have the same team-mate when teaming with a group of 4. Make it random, or have us choose. It becomes unfair tbh.

--
Add a 4 v 4 gamemodes instead of this 2 v 2 v 2 v 2. Its kinda lame there isn't. 
Make a Free for all aswell. 
You could add it to the vote section for the map. 
Ex; Blackhole 2v2v2v2    or Iceberg 4 v 4         or Blackhole Free for All 


-----
EDIT 11/25/23

Would like to say the devs have fixed most the things I had make comments about.

Climbing still feels strange, but is better, and is a step in the right direction.

Weaponry is more balanced. But they need to fix the spawning of the said items. They need to NOT spawn on people, or at peoples feet. It should be completely away from them. I've been killed by this, by an item spawning, and my character forcibly grabbing the weapon instead of the rope.

The one thing that has me titled is the game cannot, and I mean cannot, figure out where I belong on servers. It constantly puts me in servers that are no-where close to what I should be having. I always pull 100+ ping lobbies, but when im with friends that are queing for me, im under 50 ping? Makes no sense. I also stream and have GREAT internet. Dont say its my fault. This is the only game, in recent times, have I had an issue with servers like this. No other game has problems like this. 

I have knocked the review score by .2 because of the ping problems. It's almost unplayable with friends because of the latency.

146834654,english,"This game is for messing around with friends or random people. It's a party game. Yeah, you're probably not gonna win most of your games if you aren't a dedicated party animals player but that's not the point of this game, to win every single time. Though, for $20, this is not such a bad deal?

Most of the negative reviews I have seen are about the store. Bro... if you're gonna complain about the store which only sells COSMETICS that DON'T GIVE YOU AN ADVANTAGE IN GAME, you're f'n tripping my dude. You get the pleb currency for the low low price of free USD and your time (hopefully) enjoying the game. If all this game is to you is looking exactly the way you want with every skin you want but are too poor to shell out the money to support the developers who made a dumb kind of funny kind of game then you're going so ooga booga that you need to either go get a job, cry to mom or dad for their credit card cause you're 5, or touch grass.

Now that's not to say some of the criticism of this game are not valid. You can get TKed. There is, currently at the time of writing, no explicit option to do anything besides the preset game modes or custom. i.e. you can't have a game of 2v2 or 4v4 or 8v8 it'll be determined by the map you as a lobby collectively select as a majority. Some items are absolute trash to play against (AHEM STUN GUN AHEM FREEZE GUN AHEM) because they are so unforgiving when you probably unsuspectingly get hit unintentionally by your opp.

TL;DR If you're gonna give this game a trash review purely because the shop. Please sit down, re-evaluate your life, and put up or shut up. This game is for shits and giggles. Don't expect anything more or anything less. Thanks for reading and hopefully not be the next trash IGN critique and be like ""I hAtE ThiS GaMe.

146833882,english,"This game has been really fun and a joy to play so far! The different gamemodes provide fun alterations to the gameplay that are a blast to play with both friends and alone with randoms. The cast of different animals in this game provide plenty of funny scenarios and help to create the cute aesthetic that the game is trying to present. I will say that sometimes the gameplay can be a bit clunky, such as not being able to grab certain objects. However, this is only about 10-20% of the time while playing.

The people who are complaining about the falsely advertised are justified in being upset with the developers. HOWEVER: the review bombing on steam has been blow quite out of proportion. I understand that there being no offline mode may be frustrating to some people, but this is a digital only game, so you need an internet connection to buy it anyway, and I don't think it's too crazy for devs to assume that most people who would be buying this game have internet. The only time this would be an issue is if you want to play the game while travelling or during a power outage, In which case I can understand the disappointment. But it's not like you can't play the game with just friends or family, there is a custom game option which allows you to play the extent of the game, so couch co-op is still a viable option.

The other thing i've seen in reviews is discussion about the ""aggressive monetization"" this game presents. Everything is this game is purely cosmetic, meaning you aren't at a disadvantage if you don't have every new cosmetic item in the shop. I will say that the legendary skins being around $20 is absurd, but the game provides you with plenty of currency from the levelling rewards, so you would never need to pay real money for a few skins you want, you'd simply just have to play the game. Also, the game gives you a starting roster of about 12 animals, meaning you have a wide range of characters to choose from to keep yourself entertained. You can completely disregard the shop entirely if you so choose, and there aren't constant ads or notifications trying to shove skins down your throat. If you do want to get some costumes for your fuzzy friends, either buy them with in-game currency or complete different challenges to get skins and rewards. As someone who often doesn't shill out money to buy in-game cosmetics, I am completely satisfied with the system for unlockables they have in this game.

Overall, this game is incredibly fun and addicting, and I'm having a blast playing it with friends. Don't let the review bombs hurt your opinion of this game. If you loves games like Gang Beasts or Stick Fight, then definitely play this game.

Great game solo, amazing game with friends. I like that I can enjoy the game on my own in the quick match screen or have a fun night with friends in custom lobbies. The monetization isn't as bad as some people make it out to be, but I will admit that I am a little salty over getting duplicate surprise eggs and the duplicates being converted to the doggy snacks/bones instead of the egg currency. The goofy physics of the game add to the hilarity and the cute little critter costumes are adorable. Most of the maps are enjoyable, but there are a couple of the maps that make me want to pull my hair out because the game play feels so slow; Beast Soccer being the main map I dread playing because the field feels way too large. There's been more than a couple of instances where nobody managed to score a goal on Beast Soccer and it resulted in a draw. Aside from that, all in all a good game.  It's a game worthy of going on the ""party game"" list. 

I hope they give us the option to change the color of the background at some point because the orange idle screens are blech. 

animals I would like to see in the game at some point : red panda, axolotl, fox or kitsune, peacock, African wild dog/painted dog.

*** You can only get in-game Cookie currency via achievements, leveling up, or getting duplicate eggs that can only be earned via leveling, achievements, or converting real money to another in-game currency and then rolling a duplicate surprise egg. I feel like I've hit a wall with earning currency and if I want to get new outfits I'll have to spend real money to play the conversion game which seems like a huge negative. There needs to be a way to earn currency just for participating in matches. If they ever make changes to how you can earn in-game currency then I'll go back to making it a recommendation, but as it is now I cannot recommend this to people.",1695442451,1696120695,FALSE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198048118243,0,7,3143,16,947,1706969425

For starters, people complaining about the game having a cash-store are clearly omitting (or simply not realising) that the cash-store currency can be earned via the FREE BATTLE PASS. And they're all just cosmetic items.

Then some people are complaining that this PARTY game isn't single-player?? HELLO???

The only real valid criticisms of this game I can see are that local co-op isn't really that well-done. I can't imagine this will affect most of the player-base, but it is a slight over-sight. Local co-op is functional, it's just weird.

All the reviews complaining about a ""predatory"" store and battle pass, are way over exaggerating. 
The game never shoves it in your face, or has a paid for battle pass alongside the free one, there's just one ""battle pass"" everyone gets and you unlock currency/skins/characters by playing the game. You can also do the same by completing challenges like: ""Win *insert game mode* 5 times"" or ""Get 5 knockouts in a game"" etc. So unless you're really upset that you didn't get a vampire skin for the cat or something while it was a limited time, you'll honestly live.

Pros:
- Slick UI, graphics, skins, music
- Funny combat situations due to the way characters act so wonky and clunky
- Very cool map designs, so far I cannot say I disliked any maps
- Amazing party game to have a few laughs and just vent off from serious crap
- Overall very polished gameplay besides the grab mechanic which imo sometimes feels a bit more clunky than it should especially when climbing or having to grab weapons in certain angles

Cons:
- Griefers and AFK/Ragequitters in basically every other lobby if you are playing solo as of the time of this review 
- Lack of FFA/Solo game modes. Some of us cant have a party to play with at all times and as it has been proven multiple times not necessarily playing with randoms as your teammates can be the most pleasant experience especially when you are going against ""premades"" who are trying their best to achieve victory.
- Certain weapons feels overtuned such as the nunchucks and baseball bat, they are extremely precise AND spammable with their attacks
- Lacks more maps and more game modes (such as FFA/Solo, something like capture the flag, push the payload, etc)",1695439312,1695706386,TRUE,0,0,0.4769299328327178,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198858158594,0,34,1955,0,237,1702062239

ALSO, LET'S NOT FORGET THE GAME IS $20, NOT $60! I HOPE they add things like a real battle pass. I want to see new animals, new skins, and fun events to keep this game alive. I'd pay $5 or $10 every now again for more content, and continued love from the devs.

146827230,english,"I don't typically write reviews for games, but I feel like this one had a pretty harsh case of review bombing,so I'd like to do my part.

Early reviews really harped on two specific issues which have both been addressed by the devs. I won't bother explaining them - you can easily find them if you'd like. Suffice to say that there was an overreaction, and there have been some bad-faith assumptions made about some of the fixes that were made.

The current main issue I see people addressing is microtransactions. I agree that generally speaking, MTs are bad for the industry, but this game's pay model is no worse than the industry standard.

Gameplay as a whole feels great. The physics is a good combination of goofy and responsive. This is not a game to play competitively - it is a game for shenanigans, so don't expect tight and responsive controls. There is a good variety of game types, none of which seem particularly prone to griefing or cheese tactics. The maps remind me of playing Crash Bash (criminally underrated party game btw) as a kid. Character design is cute and fun, with good costumes / skins. Voice chat is a good addition, even if there are some rather annoying people on mic.

Definately worth the purchase, and would be even more so during a sale. The devs seem keen to support the game for some time in the future, which is always a plus.

146818826,english,"[h1] Please Read before you buy [/h1]

There's a lot to like, but let's be real and address all the negatives first and foremost:

1) The game is always played with 8 people. So if you've only got three friends who own the game, prepare to be matched with 8 random internet strangers, some of whom are probably 5 years old, all of whom are pretty awful. ""Well, that's not so bad, as long as my friends and I are on a team,"" I hear you say. *ahem*
2) Whether your game is a free for all, four teams of two, or two teams of four is entirely dependent on the arena selected and, I'll remind you, random internet strangers will be the ones controlling at least a considerable slice of this vote. 
3) You could work around issues 1 and 2 if the game would take a leaf from Rocket League's playbook and allow you and your group of friends to select the sort of match you'd like to play before queuing up. Seriously, why can't me and 3 friends select ""4v4 matchmaking"" and then be presented ONLY with arenas that are compatible with that? AT THIS STAGE, I'M NOT ASKING FOR NEW ARENAS OR GAMEPLAY MECHANICS -- just a filter!
4) Some new game modes would be helpful, but even they don't require all new arenas to be made. Ice Hockey, Soccer, etc could still be fun even in a 2v2 setting. But no, you *have* to be online in this PARTY game with ""PARTY"" literally written in the name. And the ""why"" you have to be online might be the biggest downside of this game by far:
5) This is a game that you purchase (for $20 USD, no less) that then expects you to shell out money indefinitely for costumes and characters. I want you to pay attention to the quotation marks I'm about to use here, because they mean a lot tonally: You can ""earn"" opportunities to ""win"" a ""chance"" at a character or costume that you want, but those require you to win matches and earn experience points. Not only does the experience required to go from level to level increase drastically (meaning that you might need to win 10 matches to ""earn"" your first ""chance"" at a character or costume, but you'll have to win 30 to ""earn"" your next), but their tied to your ""animal level"" which has a limit.

So even if you were MADE of free time and just really LOVED the game, you will eventually run out of opportunities to 'win' the character or costume you want and there are already far more characters and costumes than there will be ever be opportunities you can ""earn"" as opposed to ""buy.""

Does any of this sound familiar to you? Well, it should if you're familiar with the rise and fall (heheh) of ""Fall Guys"" which started as a pay-to-play game, people were irritated at the level of money the game was expecting you to pump into it for cosmetics and so started requesting refunds. Steam put pressure on the publisher to change their pricing, and they said, ""well if you want us to go free to play, we'll sign on with Epic since they'll pay us for exclusivity on PC"" and even with their sizable check from Epic and all the whales spending real life money to buy cosmetics, the devs still abandoned any efforts to stop hackers/cheaters from ruining the game for everyone leading in a rapid decrease in the game's popularity.

[hr][/hr]

So with that all said, let's address the good: Do you like gang beasts? Well this is that but with cute animals. [strike]And a horrific monetization system, awful match-making, no offline mode, no Steam Friend-list Integration so you have to do this weird and completely arbitrary lobby code thing because they couldn't figure out how games like Rocket League have both cross platform and friend-list support so they built their own rudimentary system instead.[/strike]

heres my actual review. the game is not bad at all some people might not be able to play it (at the moment) but for god sakes gang beasts hasnt been updated in a year! why are we complaining when the alternative (at the moment too) is just as fun. thankfully its not online only like payday 3 cause then we would have issues. its a very fun game here are the cons. 


there is too much force when you dropkick

no memorable music

no sharks on the map to be a threat

and lastly NO CLIMBING>:(

other than that  the game is a worthy alternative or just good party game in general.
there is plenty of maps to have fun around with. the only two ""gamemodes"" are beeg soccerball soccer and 2v2v2v2v2 fights from what ive seen and played. more gamemodes would be very good to keep players you know.. playing? i bet theres gonna be updates adding that so quadfingers crossed over here",1695423111,1695495206,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561199050452815,0,74,300,0,68,1696289855

The game have wobbly mechanic that was cute and funny at first, but feels more like clunky controls 

The developer put a lot of their time and energy into making a lot of cute animals to choose from, they all share the same move set, so they're just a bunch of skins to choose from

The game mode is either last team standing, score points, or some objective you have to do. Some maps can be short or drawn out long depending on how the random teammates participate. Most of the games I've played there's been afk because they don't want the penalty of leaving a game mode and being in timeout

So that's 10% of the game, the other 90% of the game feels like playing a mobile phone app with the gacha slot machine to win a random skin and grinding to level up to unlock in game currency to unlock certain animals or skins. I don't see a lot of replay value after 2 hours of playing the game, so I refunded the game and got my money back.

_____________________________________________________________________
But the skin system is... weird.
You start with 10 animals  and for skins there is too much mecanics:

Like, you have a ""Battle Pass"" (Only free rewards, no premium stuff) and you can get game currency (bones) and skins from it

With bones, you can buy skins in the shop (Shop have random skins and is update every day and week) but also with 
bill (The thing you can buy with real money and get some from Battle Pass)

In the pass, you can unlock coins to open a loot box to get a random skin. You can also buy loot boxe with real money. All the skin the loot box gives you can also be bought with bones / bills if the skin is in the shop

Most of the common skins are worst than their free version. (Just a color variant from the default)

You can also unlock special skins with Steam Achievements and (I think) you can only unlock those with achievements
_____________________________________________________________________
To conclude, this game is very good and haves other game mode than ""Punch animals in the head""
I don't regret my money and will continue to play. But, the absence of server in Africa/Australia, the skin system that is... not bad but far from good... make it hard to grade.

If you just want some fun, this game is awesome and worth the price
If you want skins, then... it isn't the best game for this. I would have said otherwise if you could get free bones from matches and if you could buy everything with bones.

Their store is predatory, with skins that cost more than the game itself, multiple currencies, real money lootboxes (that can be duplicates!), timed sales to abuse that fear of missing out, twitch drops, you know the deal.

Also, the censorship is insane. You can barely complete an English sentence without it being censored, making people think you're cussing, which in turn gets you reported, and then (temporarily) banned. Want to appeal that ban? Tough luck: you'll have to write a ticket on their website for that, but it won't even allow you to login.

I had access to the playtest and found that the added gamemodes on release was refreshing. My hope is that they will continue to add more gamemodes, which I'm suspecting they will! The gameplay is very similar to Gang Beasts but I believe the added cosmetics to each animal will give everybody a way to customize their favorite critter. There's nothing like seeing a Darth Vader Duck get knocked out by a boomerang he threw, meanwhile a Wizard Crocodile is desperately swimming towards safety, all while you have a Pink Shark with a t-shirt on it's head camping the edge. 

While the gameplay supports solo queue, it is far superior to play with a group online (up to 4 players per lobby), with there being support for far more players in a custom lobby. 

However, while I do recommend picking this game up for a fun time I'm a bit saddened to see some micro-transactions pop up in the store for some characters. It's not as egregious as other games, as most cosmetics are available through leveling up your account (and spending the two different currencies available). My hope is that most of that content will be unlocked for free in the future.

Some of the weapons are incredibly overpowered compared to the rest. I'm looking at YOU (shovel), but the balancing of different weapons is something they can fix in the future.

146793562,english,"[h1] To clarify some things [/h1]

In case some of these details are the ones making you doubt about buying the game

[b] Battle Pass? [/b]
No, it's the level up system. There's no ""premium"" battle pass nor you can buy ""tiers"" (aka player levels)

[b] Money for skins? [/b]
For the most premium ones, and the level up system gives you """"""some"""""" (still little). Cause the free currency/leveling up is enough to unlock 99% of the animals. If you care about the prettiest skins, yeah, money. But if you just want to have a blast with fun gameplay, no need to bring your wallet, and many of the Epic free currency skins are still very good

[b] No Offline Mode? [/b]
True, it sucks, so if that is your main point to get the game, it doesn't have it. But it still allows for local couch players to join your party and jump into the game together

[b] Repetitive gameplay? [/b]
No. Looking from outside, 3 MAIN Gamemodes may sound like too little variety, but every map (20 in total) of every mode brings something different to the table, so whenever you DO get into a map you've played before, you'll probably want to try a different strategy from last time.

[b] Personal opinion? [/b]
The game is amazing, simple as that. Sucks that there's no offline mode, but that doesn't really take away from how fun it is to play. It has monetization but is way too far from being the worst in recent times, only skin related. The game has a wide variety of maps that keep gameplay fresh as you try to learn the core gameplay of your character and the maps.

146791471,english,"So this is kinda my personal opinion but I think the game still needs some work on it.
The main problem I have with the game is the fact it costs £16 and STILL contains micro transactions. In itself that isn't a problem I mean, look at minecraft. But with Party Animals Nemo Bucks are NOT cheap, mixed with the fact that the cosmetics are EXPENSIVE. If I wanted to buy what I wanted I probably would of payed twice the amount I payed for the game (kind of dumb).
The offline mode thing is kinda of a let down for me, it is kind of the reason I bought the game. They have addressed it though (although I was kind of hoping it would come in the furture).
Also the fact you have to buy the game, buy Nemo Bucks THEN HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOUR ITEM TO COME IN THE STORE AGAIN. Even if you save up using levels (which takes foreverrrrr) you will still have to wait MORE time for your item to come back. 
Now I did play this with my friend and I did only buy this game so he'll be happy (and i luv playin with him :>). So any of my opinions shared here are coming from the view of someone who doesn't normally play these games.
If you're okay with looking bland and just playing the game for fun, then yeah check this out.

For those looking to compare it to Gang Beasts: I believe as a general rule that Party Animals is better for having an even skillset for everyone, with a risk for action spam from enemies (such as an opponent spamming the punch button over your head when you get knocked out - it's on occasion I'll struggle to get up because I'm not given the opportunity to fight back). In my experience, Gang Beasts is harder for new players to pick up. So Party Animals definitely seems more intuitive and easier for new or inexperienced players.
I do personally think Gang Beasts is still unmatched in the absolute chaos and screw-offery-ness that people know and love it for - but that isn't to say Party Animals doesn't have it's own charm and chaos, even if the chaos does seem a little more controlled. Beyond game mechanics, I would chalk this up to the environment in Gang Beasts being much more likely to fall apart around the players - I would not cite this as a 'pro' or 'con' over Party Animals. The games are similar but also very different so it's hard to compare on every front!
I do like the group activities better in Party Animals if you're looking for better group/team based rounds. 

Overall though, I'd say Party Animals is a great addition to your game library if you're looking for fun party based games. If you like silly physics in your games, I'd say Party Animals definitely holds its own, and neither replaces Gang Beasts, nor is it outshined by Gang Beasts.

I read a lot of reviews complaining about offline mode, this is not really an issue for me. I can see why people would have issues with that, however its something that should be addressed if a large population where expecting that format of game play.

As far as the micro-transaction complaints. 

Y'all gotta be kidding me crying this much. Literally 99% of all video games on the market currently have micro-transactions.. 

[b] IF [/b] it was in the case of you only get these 5 extra maps if you PAY for the micro-transaction, like ya go ahead and cry. . 

But [b] LITERALLY ALL [/b] the micro-transactions are... [b]Skins.. cosmetics... [/b] like who cares? The entire game is completely ruined because they have skins?  **ROLL EYES**

Go look at any Tripple A title. shoot go look at mortal kombat 1, its an additional $30 for 5 characters. Thats something to whine about, Not skins..


---------------------------
[h2] pros [/h2]
-Voip
-Good variety of maps 
-Loads of character models to choose from
-Game requires a bit of skill to play, however learning curve isn't bad.
-Simple control scheme works on both KB&M and gamepads
- easy to group up with steam friends, or even make new friends from games you've played.
-Haven't experienced any bugs or glitchiness.
---------------------------------
[h2] cons [/h2]
-A few of my games where super laggy and matched with people far from server causing high peer to peer Latency.
-Sometimes grabbing / throwing can feel clunky.
-Some of the weapons are very imbalanced, i.e. lolipop and shovel. Players being able to sit on your already KO'd body and swing over and over and you just get deleted is not fun.
-Report system is only available after pictures have been taken and if player leaves before then you can't report. (This should be changed and be able to report players mid game)
-No AFK detection mid game
-KO timer is not equal - This should likely be normalized.
-No indication of about to be KO'd.",1695370568,1695442332,TRUE,2,0,0.5238095521926879,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198002877503,182,22,607,0,396,1703934147

All in all said. Games pretty fun. Tutorial is a bit lacking. I'd like some clarity on what buttons to mash to wake up faster, and also grabbing and holding onto stuff like boxes and chains with handles (black hole lab) your stamina drains even when not moving, being grabbed, or being pulled by the black hole.. that just seems silly to me. There shouldnt be any drain when theres no strain. ALSO climbing is kind of bad. How often do i just not climb the edge of the ice or the edge of the submarine and just kind of... do a half pullup? come on gang beasts has been out for a while and the climbing on there is great compared to this shit

*Also im seeing that AU dont have its own servers? Doesnt that mean to host a private couch session youd have to still go through laggy asia servers just to play with your lads? Does that affect your latency with your couch session? This shouldnt even be a thought or concern though since you should be able to play without and internet connection for a game that you have to pay money to play and have access too in this genre specifically

------
Pros:
-Super addictive sandbox physics gameplay, so many crazy scenarios
-Amazingly original, snappy, and most importantly responsive UI!
-Creative game modes along with many maps, each of them having unique spin of their own
-Graphics are Phenomenal, seeing the adorable creatures Fluff and all in HD as well
-Controls are quite responsive, but at the same time sloppy enough to add on the ""Party"" like unpredictable gameplay
-So, Soooo many cute playable characters to choose from and each one not only having different alts, but the alts even have their own different variations!
-If you crash or lag out of the game, it has a ""Join in progress game"" so you don't miss out with your friends in matchmaking or custom games
-Game has a custom game community browser with a TON of host options, including adding AI for some teams that seem uneven.
-Voice Chat is open(also by default) so you'll get a giggle out of the random context that players spew out lol
-Free Battle Pass that gives you tons of in-game currency as well as Nemo Bucks to buy within the shop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONS:
-Apparently, the game cannot be played offline, which is always a big ""No"" in my book. No reason why this can't be played offline.
-Supposedly, Australia players are shit out of luck as the closet servers they can play on is within Asia, take this with a grain of salt as I couldn't find a way to confirm this since I don't reside there.
-I had 2 friends crash often here and there as we played, however they did mentioned they have been crashing with other games prior to this one recently. One of the PC crashes my friend received was an error in terms of C++ or w/e
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Controversy:
To be honest, I have always believed that battle passes and item shops can be done properly in games, the idea alone is actually good, but it really matters how it's executed. So far, no games have come close to this however(expect TF2).

I will say though I think that how monetization in this game is handled fairly well, because you can earn the currency within the game by just playing, and No.
-You don't have to grind for hours at all just for a tiny amount of Nemo Bucks or Dog Bones. As only 3-4 hours in, I was able to purchase about half or more of the skins within the store. You can simply play and earn everything in a reasonable time play I strongly believe and I think the option to pay with real money is solely there if you were just to be impatient honestly. I understand the game is $20 itself, however the game offers so much already to begin with, worthy of that $20.
Any extra content beyond that you can unlock with just earned in-game currency alone.

-From all the reviews or statements in regard of the monetization within the game, I personally believe it may be a lot of ignorance or people not fully understanding how the system actually works within the game. A lot of people only jumping the gun the moment that they would see you have the option to spend real-life money into the game, then automatically calling it bad and review bombing it.

I am heavily against monetization in game, however I'm always open minded if I feel it's done properly and I do believe this is one of them with some of my statements.",1695356887,1695357319,TRUE,1,0,0.5258620381355285,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198149552562,154,10,418,0,305,1695774339

I played the playtest with my friend three years ago and immediately fell in love with the game. The easy controls, the stunning graphics, and most importantly the addicting gameplay. 

I personally give the game a 9.8 out of 10.

I have seen people dislike the game because they claimed it was going to be ""Offline"" and it isn't. 
It's couch co-op, but you need an internet connection to play.
For me, that doesn't bother me at all. My friends all play online together anyway, so only playing online is no a problem.
I think it's bad on the developers or at least the marketing team (If they have one) that they mislead people. They needed to be more clear.

Another thing, I have heard. Is that, there is a loot box system in the game
Now at this point, we all know what that means. 
But, I don't think that people realize the level-up system in the game. LITERALLY GIVES YOU FREE MONEY!!!!

So now looking at the loot box system, it isn't bad. 
Sure you can spend real money on the game currency. 
There is just no need.

Overall I give this game I have been waiting for 9 punches for every kick.

Sure... you can play local co op by hosting an online match, locking it, and then adding a second player by unplugging and plugging in a second controller multiple times while cursing USB plugs because I can never pass my dexterity saving throw required to plug in a USB cord.  No biggie, but why the heck are we forced into split screen for pseudo-local-co-op?  

1998 called, they said they want their local co-op split screen back.  Oi.  Okay.  Nobody called wanting their split-screen back; I'm just venting and miffed.  And that was a terrible burn.  And honestly, I don't care a whole lot; I am just tired of my kid killing me in Gang Beasts and thought I'd have the edge with Party Animals.

To start with the audacity: slapping a $20 price tag on a game riddled with microtransactions is a bold move, but not one to be applauded. If I'm dishing out that much upfront, I expect an experience that feels complete, not an invitation to an endless cash grab.

And speaking of the basics, who releases a party game with no local co-op these days? Local multiplayer is the lifeblood of party games, and its omission here is akin to throwing a party without any music. Dealbreaker, indeed.

The cherry on top of this disappointment sundae is the online-only requirement. I mean, seriously? In an age where most games are offering flexibility, ""Party Animals"" chains its players to a perpetual online tether. Great for those moments when you want to play solo and your internet's down, right? Oh wait, you can't.

Comparing it to ""Gang Beasts"" might be doing a disservice to the latter. Where ""Gang Beasts"" gave us hours of laughter and memorable moments, ""Party Animals"" delivers an experience that feels more like the aftermath of a party—littered, messy, and leaving you wondering why you came in the first place.

I have around 55 hours total on the game. I played ~51 hours on the play tests. 

This game is one of the most fun and polished games to come out in the last 3 years.

If you are on the fence about getting this game due to the ""mixed"" reviews, get it, especially if you and a few friends are thinking about it. Even for all the solo players, there are at least 100 hours of fun playing this game. 

TLDR: People complain about everything. The game is really fun, polished, and smooth. One of the better games to release in the last 3 years.

A few issues that arose due to bad server connection:
-Stuck on initial loading screen.
-Stuck on the cloud loading screen
-Stuck on the round number screen
-Stuck in a death screen, but never sent to spectator mode
-Stuck in spectator mode when the new round starts
-Game not counting wins or losses properly on client side.
-Massive input delay. ~1 or 2 seconds of delay

I really hope this is due to the high player count causing too much stress on the servers, but the game is totally unplayable for me. These happen to me on EVERY match. If you live in US South, you will most likely have the same problems as I did. [/strike]

For all the crying reviews about offline mode the devs have posted on that note and the misunderstanding:
This new meta of review-bombing is just not it, you can disregard all the negative reviews that have the word ""offline"" in it.
If you want to play offline, you can log off steam and play your flashplayer games offline.

All that aside, the game runs butter smooth, ping is great on all servers, matchmaking is instant, and you'll have a blast playing the game ONLINE. 

Solo or with friends you'll enjoy it, the physics in the game are fun to watch, the rounds are short and enjoyable, progression, skin/character unlocks, getting better all feels great as you play more.

I was a little confused why this game has mixed reviews and I saw that it's because it doesn't have an offline mode which is valid since it was advertised to have an offline mode, but the game is still a TON of fun. The game also does have cosmetics/in-game purchases which people don't like (even though it's optional lmao), but most of the skins are easily obtainable through the FREE currency in the game (cookies). 

Overall, I'd highly recommend this game even if you don't have a big group of friends to play with because playing with random people is still a lot of fun, especially with the voice chat. If you're into online multiplayer, this will work for you but if you're looking for a single player offline game you will be disappointed.

146731928,english,"To start off, the mixed reviews have nothing to do with the gameplay. They're all concerns with offline play, and micro-transactions and lootboxes. Sure, I get the outrage.

Gameplay wise, this is the party brawler to get. The controls feel clean (admittedly a little cleaner during beta) and the action is frenetic and fun. My friends and I were playing Gang Beasts for a long time, but it was more under duress because nothing else was fitting the bill. My complaints with Gang Beasts were that the stamina bar was obfuscated, so I had no idea what state my guy was in, the controls felt unresponsive, so I was just button mashing and hoping for the best.

Both of those issues are addressed, though admittedly, the controls feel a tad more sluggish on Party Animals than it did previously. 

The levels are interesting and varied, with different objectives beyond just beating the hell out of each other. I will say that some of Gang Beasts levels are more interesting, such as the truck racing and the window washer levels.

My biggest gripe at the moment is the confusing way to add friends. We have a dedicated group of friend who all want to play together and adding a friend in the game menu just sends them a steam message with a link to the game. The only way to reliably add a friend (as of 9/20/2023) is to create a game, have them join the game, and then add them as a friend in the game lobby.

But other than that, it's been an enjoyable experience, and a welcome addition to the party brawler genre.

With that out of the way, Party Animals takes what gang beasts had, removes the jank and inconsistency, alongside painting everything over with an amazing art style and cute animals.

146723835,english,"So after playing for a few hours, I heard about the review bombing. And a good half of them are about the micro transactions which...seem plain dumb. One half of THOSE is people saying ""Why are some skins more than the cost of the game!?"" whilst the others are ""This game is expensive, How dare they!"" and to both parties I ask....Have you been sleeping under a rock since the 90's? Any modern AAA game is 3x the cost of Party Animals and most will have micro transactions in them as well. Call of Duty costs far more than this game AND has skins that cost more than this game. War Thunder, a 'free to play' game has vehicles in it that cost as much as a AAA game, and people suck it up like fine wine. 

The other half are a split between servers [which I can't attest to], and Offline mode. There are people upset that this game has no solo mode. A game called...PARTY Animals...has no solo mode. Colour me surprised! Why would you ever pick up a game that has always presented itself as a multiplayer brawler and think it has a solo mode. It's like people have lost their critical thinking skills. 

Onto brighter things, the game plays well. It has a simple premise and it nails it, the brawls are intense and though sometimes I am frustrated by a random lucky punch from an opponent, in the very next round I'll be crying with laughter as I knock someone into next week with a lolipop.

This game is so fun to play with friends, both locally with splitscreen and online against people AND splitscreen locally. Yes, the term ""offline"" seems to be a misunderstanding and they even addressed it on the game news feed. Splitscreen is a common term for gaming and came from a time where games didn't have any online functions at all. So i understand the misinterpretation on both sides. If that is truly important to you for this to have offline, you can refund the game if you have played less than 2hours on steam, no questions asked. But from what i can tell in the negative review section, seems everyone is enjoying the game and have not requested a refund. So it seems like everyone is butthurt for nothing or rather just joining in the crowd to get angry over trivial matters per usual.

The legitimate concerns in the reviews I completely understand. 3-4 TOTAL game servers, zero servers for OCE people. Those are big problems that can be remedied by the devs and absolutely need to be fixed.

146721594,english,"My overall verdict is definitely a positive one. 

Lets start with the elephant in the room: The presence of micro-transactions in a paid game feels very muddy and I frequently come back to the question ""if everything has a dollar value in game, why isn't this just free to play?"" and the answer to that is fairly simple. The gameplay loop isn't strong enough to support a f2p model and the ultimate goal still is a party game you play with friends in person. The game reflects this fairly strongly in that you technically can buy stuff with cash, but just playing the game will get you stuff faster than the typical f2p game. I preordered the deluxe version and don't intend to spend more money, but in doing that i had approximately 10 dollars worth of the cash currency to spend in game and have no complaints about buying the loot boxes. It was fine. In one 30min sitting i had earned through playing one loot box anyhow. So really, you can just play and it'll be fine. 

The controversy over offline mode is kinda of moot to me. As long as it plays smooth as butter when I have friends over I really don't care. 

But, now on to the good stuff. Gameplay. I have to say I really enjoy this game. Like a lot. It is not an easy game by any account and that relates entirely to the fact that it is physics based. Controls come out of the box needing a quick remap (default maps jump to Y, when every game i've ever played maps to X) but once you're set up right things start to work pretty nice. Goals vary from map to map and going solo or with a team is also tied to them. I've found games with 2 player teams are my favorite, and probably the perfect balance of chaos and strategy. At present i've only played online but I have a group of friends ocming by this weekend to see how this fairs with a 6 player couch game. The game looks quite nice on a 65in 4k TV and doesn't melt my graphics card in the process. The thing that really attracted me to this game, aside from the solid art style, was a sense that your first time sitting down at the game you don't need a high level of competency to have fun and do reasonably well. Playing in the beta and now launch confirms that. It's just a fun party game. 

There is a part of me that honestly feels like the game could use some blood/gore to balance out the intense constant cuteness. This is a change that I don't expect to see, but there is something about it that almost reminds me ""happy tree friends"" and I want that game. But, like I said, that isn't something I expect to happen. Your toddler can play this game and not get scared at any point. The only limiting factor is adults will struggle to control their character, so the toddler isn't going to be able to play. 

I don't know if I would go as far as to praise this into the sky and say it is worth buying just to play random strangers online. I don't feel like it crosses that boundary, but I'm sure many people will buy it explicitly for that. For me this is the kind of game that you need to be sitting next to the person to get the full experience. 

20 bucks is a fair price. I paid 30 for the deluxe and i'm good with that price since I am literally inviting half a dozen people to explicitly come over to play this. I will say though, if you see this on sale you 100% should buy. Fun game.

The maps are fun, all of them have good variety and break up the gameplay in enjoyable and interesting ways. Some more interesting than others imo but still fun nonetheless.

For a $20 indie game, I feel like a lot of these ""problems"" should get overlooked, since in the grand scheme of things they aren't that important. But if u think the game looks fun give it a try and form your own opinion. 

If the ""offline"" mode or skins end up being that big of a problem. This games not for u anyways. 

These do not prevent u from playing the actual game at all. I honestly thought what was in the 2020 demo was going to be whole game basically. I.e a couple of maps and beating up your friends. 3 years later they added so much more than I could've imagined.

146713891,english,"Honest opinion with pros and cons: 

PROS:
- Super fun game where I can play with and against my friends, and play against others in online matchmaking too. 
- Not meant to be a game taken incredibly serious and is more so a fun game to joke and mess around with friends, and at the same time generate rivalry against opponents. For example, my friends and I were a 4-stack and played against another 4-stack, and we had a little series going on where we would re-queue and face each other again. It was a lighthearted rivalry and we all added each other after. 
- ""Battle Pass"" is free, and gives you Nemo Bucks where you can unlock skins through a randomizer or through the ""shop"". Definitely a bonus as long as it remains free like so. 


CONS:
- There appears to be some server issues, where I have been in a couple games that the server lags/stutters ever few seconds... almost unplayable. I also know it was not just my connection, as my whole party was experiencing the same thing.
- Sometimes the power of hits seems random, where you feel like it should've knocked someone out but they just bounce off of them... That could just be a skill issue though. 

OVERALL:
Great game and I can see my friends and I playing more. As long as the game continues to get support and gets updated and doesn't just become a cash grab. I definitely recommend, and I would also recommend using a controller over keyboard and mouse.",1695308863,1695308863,TRUE,2,0,0.5105566382408142,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198069652267,143,4,1166,0,358,1695833666

146708901,english,"I've been waiting for this game for YEARS was it worth the wait? Absolutely! This game is an joy to play for mindless chaos, cute animals and blunt-force trauma. Playing on my own with A.I, had me cracking up, playing with my friends? Hardest I've laughed playing a game in a long time. My personal opinion? It's like Gang Beasts, but way more appealing. It looks better, the physics are wacky as hell, the sound effects alone get me laughing and the game is just oozing with charm.
Micro-transactions, by the time I'm writing this, are JUST for skins, skins that have no effect on gameplay what so ever and they are skins that CAN BE BOUGHT with ingame currency earned from leveling up or playing online games. Gaining XP is a bit slower playing solo, but if you're not the obsessive type that NEEDS TO EARN EVERY SKIN IN A WEEK, you'll manage JUST FINE, by just ENJOYING THE GAME. So any outrage based around THAT is being blown out of the water. If this changes? Then I'll have reason to give grievances, but as the game stands right now? They make no effect to the gameplay nor are they invasive in any way. Don't let reviews talking smack about the game, using THAT as the main point of reference for the bad review, sway you from getting it. There's a decent number of maps and different game modes to play, with more coming down the line I'm sure. Some might find the price tag a little steep for the kind of game it looks like, on the outside, but if you get enough friends together, you will have a blast everytime you boot it up.

I'm thrilled to say that all those countless hours I spent honing my skills in mini party games have finally paid off!

My friends and I frequently find ourselves discussing our love for these mini arena choices, and it's such an amazing feeling. 

I must give a huge shoutout to Recreate Games for creating such a fantastic experience. You guys truly nailed it! I'm so impressed that I'm now planning to seek out local competitions to put my skills to the test. Can't wait to see what the future holds!

cons:
• not a lot of variety of maps + gamemodes. let me throw people in grinders here too. also let players make their own maps?
• no party chat, everyone can hear you regardless. I learned the hard way, not taking any questions.
• needs more weapon variety, may I suggest a lightsaber?
• gacha pull system for skins, RAHHH!!! I HATE GACHA!!!
• penalty for leaving games??? for a party game??? when people can fill in and take your spot??? *league of legends ptsd ensues*
• nO OffLiNe mOdE
• clearly needs a good creative director to make this game prosper. i can take one for the team and be that person.
• [b]MOST IMPORTANTLY: NO RED PANDA CHARACTER. TRULY OUTRAGEOUS. FIX SOON OR I REFUND.[/b]

146697346,english,"Overall, it's a very good game and also a lot of fun to play with friends. I can't say for sure whether one should give a positive or negative review, but in the end, I've decided to go with a negative one. 

Why?

- There's in-game currency that's hard to come by, and acquiring a skin requires a lot of playtime.
- You can exchange real-money currency for in-game currency, but not the other way around.
- Skins are simply too expensive, costing far more than 10-15€, which, in my opinion, is too much. 5€ would be more reasonable for what you get.
- Whether it's offline or online, it doesn't really matter to me as long as I'm at my PC. However, on the Nintendo Switch, I'd have to subscribe to play it at home with friends, which would bother me. So, that's also a negative point.
- The camera takes some getting used to and is not always ideal in situations where you're wedged in and end up staring at a wall.
- As a pre-order bonus, I received 240 Bucks, which I appreciate, but I can't really buy anything with 240 Bucks. I'd have to buy an additional 1760 Bucks with real money just to get something, so the bonus seems to be more of an incentive for further purchases.
- The AI opponents are unpredictable. Why does an Easy Bot act so foolishly in some games but perform like a pro in others, like in Hockey? It's illogical and difficult to determine which type of bots to play against.
- In custom games, there are too few settings. I'd like to play some games for longer periods, even if I turn off HP and Knockout. After just 1 minute, the poison or ice comes into play, so you always end up dying from it. You can't just have a relaxed 10-minute brawl or deal with external forces that you can't control and can't disable or adjust.

That's why I love indie games; you can really feel the passion and dedication that goes into them, and developers are grateful for every cent. They release update after update, and it shows. Here, it's mentioned that it's a small team that takes their time with things. Unfortunately, I see a lot of profit-driven practices from studios like EA or Tencent, where the developers supposedly come from. It's all about making quick money, squeezing as much as possible out of players, and as soon as it's no longer profitable, they simply let the game die.

I don't foresee much new content for the future if the game isn't profitable for the developers. I believe that in a year, no one will be picking up the game anymore, and it'll be over with no further updates or improvements. That's why I'm skeptical about the whole concept, especially after such a long wait – in my case, two years of anticipation.

Therefore, I can currently only advise against making a purchase recommendation. Nevertheless, I continue to play the game without investing a single cent, as the buying tactics don't resonate with me in this project.",1695288519,1695288519,FALSE,6,0,0.5034226179122924,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561197998384930,0,6,2478,0,171,1697223215

146696981,english,"Let me start of by saying the game itself is kinda fun, maybe a little overpriced for the amount of maps available.

For the people wondering if the game runs on the Steam Deck, it does. Around 50 FPS on medium settings, with some minor frame drops here and there.

One thing I don't like about this game are the super overpriced cosmetics. Sure, you don't need them to play the game and no gameplay mechanics are locked behind a paywall (thank god) But the ""clothing"" in the game are more expensive than they are in real life which is pretty nuts.

If this game was free-to-play it would change my perspective, but it's €18,00 and still has the same in game prices of games that are free.

So why do I not recommended this game? Well not just because of the overpriced cosmetics, more because the developers were advertising this game to be playable ""offline"" which is a complete lie. Now they are downplaying this statement saying it's ""miscommunication"" which is insane to me. How can there be developers that have a history working for EA working on this title, and have the balls to claim they do not know the difference between offline and online couch co-op.

It's absolutely a case of false advertising, and with this statement (imo) they are showing their true colors, and honestly I don't trust them to resolve further issues that may come along the way equitable.

This is hands down one of the best party games I've played in years, the gameplay is pure stupid fun, the game modes are creative and unique, and the style is just such eye candy.

There is no way you've been pushing the promise of offline couch multiplayer for nearly 3 YEARS only to have it be completely absent in the final release and chalked up to a ""misunderstanding"" with little to no plans of implementing it even AFTER all the backlash.

I am for sure still gonna clock in a stupid amount of hours into this game laughing my ass off with friends. When it comes to local play, once you get around the inconvenient local setup and garbage split screen UI and whatnot, it still works perfectly fine as a couch multiplayer game. And despite the façade the game wore up until launch, it has still been very much worth the wait, but for those questioning the purchase I simply cannot recommend supporting it until the devs get their shit together, listen to the community, add offline play, and dumb it down with the live service microtransaction bullshit.

Gacha isn't the only way or the primary way to get skins/outfits, and you can get plenty of spins by just playing, AND there are guaranteed odds, so if you spin 10/30 times you will get an epic/legendary skin or outfit.

146691156,english,"[h1] 8/10 [/h1] [h1] Great Game With Endless Hours of Fun [/h1] 
[h2] but... [/h2] [h3] I Can Already Hear the Incoming Critiques [/h3]

Since this is Recreate Game's [b] FIRST [/b] game we should cut them some slack. Giving them feedback is way better than just attacking the developers. They are listening to suggestions and feedback on Discord so you should be happy they are doing this unlike other companies who completely ignore the community. You can check their official pages for more info and get updates.

This game is [b] AMAZING! [/b] I've waited over [b] THREE YEARS [/b] for it to come out and it's just fun as I remembered. Although I think they could have released it back then and slowly added updates to it, I know there won't be the same amount of hype for it as before. Hours will fly by and each game does not feel long at ALL! Each game is different and you will always find some crazy way to win or lose. This is why I rate it a 8/10.

[b] Now for the bad. [/b]

[h3] Weapons: [/h3] Something that I've noticed many people comment on, is the balancing of the weapons. 
Some weapons are too strong or too random and this factor only frustrates players like myself. If they can make it a set amount of damage per weapon so it can be a skill issue then it will be a blessing, but I doubt this will happen anytime soon. ANY weapon should not be able to throw you SO FAR! One hit with any weapon it could be a game over for that match.

[h3] Grabbing: [/h3] This might sound stupid but why am I able to grab on to well, ANYTHING! I know this was intentional as I heard in the tutorial you can grab, pick up, and punch anything. BUT WHY! I find myself constantly grabbing on the floor, team members, and that [b] random brick [/b] on [b] ""Ichiban"" [/b]. They should have a feature that only allows you to grab on to certain parts of the map NEVER the floor, as well as not being able to grab and knock out your teammates even though in certain cases you need too for them to survive. I think the game will do just fine and it will get rid of those annoying cases where either you or your teammate ruin the match because one knocks the other out.

[h3] Maps: [/h3] Some maps need balancing and minor tweaks. For example, I can already tell ""Beast Hockey"" will have the lowest play count. It's not because it isn't fun but it's because the puck, and how heavy it is, makes it so unpredictable, anything can happen. You can't run around it on time. You can't stand in front of it or you get knocked and thrown with it. You can hardly move because it's ice...(why not on ice skates and make it faster/better control). You also can't aim properly because of the HUGE size. I've seen 4 PLAYERS leave the map all at once and then our team got kicked because there were not enough players. I can hardly imagine how other matches are going. So balancing and minor changes to some maps will make them fun and people will want to play them.


[h3] Conclusion: [/h3] There are more things people are rightfully complaining about but it's not a part of the core gameplay. Offline, Servers, Loot Eggs, Demo Rewards, Item Shop, all can be forgotten when you just want to play the game. Well except for offline but you can't expect a 1v1 or a 2v6 (AI) match to be as much fun as the 2v6 (real players) which the maps were intended for. That was an error on their part and if you bought it for offline play then just get a refund. I promise you'll keep the game and it will be much more fun playing online.
 
Well, let me know if you agree or disagree with what I mentioned and you better hope I don't come across you in a lobby. [b] ""WAALLTUHHHHH""-Convict Sparky aka VeteranClashGaming [/b]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]The Good[/h1]
I played the original demo back in October 2020, along with my friends. We all loved it; it was simple and lighthearted, with easy-to-learn mechanics, cute fuzzy animals, vibrant colours, and creatively designed maps. When I got playtest access, I was excited to learn that all these highlights had survived the long development process and had even been improved upon in some respects – new maps, new animals, new ways to customise your animal. Unfortunately, these were the only improvements over the original demo, and the only good things I have to say about the game.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[h2]Monetisation[/h2]
At 20 USD, Party Animals is comparable in price to other party games. Unlike other party games though, the upfront cost doesn't grant access to everything. Many items need to be purchased using one of 2 currencies - Cookies or Nemo Bucks - or randomly obtained from Eggs (their cute version of lootbox / gacha mechanics). Initially, I was under the impression that all these currencies could be obtained through regular gameplay [i]or[/i] real-money purchases, and so I treated it as a progression system (I have since learned that Nemo Bucks are only available for real-money purchases). Thinking that everything was tied to these 3 currencies, I was surprised on day 1 when I opened the shop to see a bundle for a new character that didn't appear in my locker - the ""Cabbage Dog"". It was only available through a bundle costing real money - 5.9 USD to be exact, or a little under 1/3 the price of the game. It was incredibly insulting after paying an upfront cost to [i]immediately[/i] be presented with content that was inaccessible without paying more.
[h2]Online-Only Service[/h2]
I wasn't surprised that the time-limited playtest required an internet connection to play, but I wasn't expecting it from the full release. Unfortunately, there is [i]no[/i] offline mode. Want to look through your locker at the animals and cosmetics you’ve collected? You need to be connected to the internet. Having some friends over and want to play with them on your couch? You need to be connected to the internet. Going to a party and want to bring this game along? Better hope they’ll give you their internet password. Going on a road trip? Plane ride? Camping trip? Anywhere else with a lack of stable internet? Tough. You can’t play this game, even locally, until you’re reconnected.
[h2]Longevity[/h2]
Even if you're someone who is always connected to the internet, the online-only model makes me question the longevity of the game. Party games tend to be short-lived. They are the type of game you return to when you want mindless fun, not the type of game you play consistently. As such, party games tend to quickly lose their players. For a game that's online only, a consistently low playerbase is the indicator of an upcoming end-of-service. When that happens, say goodbye to your access, and any hope of playing your beloved game again.

[h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1]
Party Animals is a solid party game. Its controls and mechanics are well polished, its visuals are gorgeous, and each match is full of mindless fun. You will enjoy your time with it, especially if you have friends to play with. But enjoyment is not the same as being worth the price. The lack of an offline mode means that even your local games will be affected by high ping, and further means that you will lose access altogether if/when the servers get shut down. If you [i]really[/i] want to get it, wait for a sale... but there are plenty of party game alternatives available that can be played offline or online, and [i]they[/i] don’t charge for cosmetics.",1695275634,1695275656,FALSE,11,1,0.5883107781410217,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198063270568,0,1,28,0,9,1695940097

Yeah it doesn't have offline, but you can play locally with your friends, yet you still need to be connected to the internet, since your game progress is linked to their server. 

Also indeed the game has micro transactions for some skins (About 5-10% of the skins) but the rest can be obtained by just playing, and HEY! All games these days have micro transactions for skins, you're not paying to get advantage over other players, but to look cuter maybe.

So to conclude this: Party animals is one of the best (If not the best) fun physics games on steam right now, the replay-ability of the maps and modes is just amazing and funny.

[h1] A amazing game flawed by interesting design choices [/h1]
First things first, this game is awesome, I've played about 6 hours in the closed beta, and its a fun game, but there are somethings the developers could have done and shouldn't have done that would have made this game better. My first gripe with it is that it has excessive micro transactions, It would make sense if it was a free game, but as it is now, there is no reliable way to get the premium currency after you get all the achievements, and levels (making you pay for more skins). First there is a fortnite like item shop with rotating skins in it to make you fear of not being able to get it again after the time is up or FOMO, then there is a gacha or loot box system where you get you egg coins and basically gamble for a skin, this is baffling. we already paid 20 - 30 dollars on this game and now were expected to pay more? I know they have to make money but this is way too excessive. Next is the game modes, why isn't there a queue??? Every time there is team mode, which I really don't like playing as there is no ""Team"" as everyone is just doing there own thing, I end up leaving the game and getting a match penalty. just add a queue for the game modes you want to play in, pretty simple. Next and this is a big one for some people, why is there no offline play? You wanna play offline split screen with some buddys? Too bad, because that isn't allowed, because how are you gonna spend money if you are offline? Speaking of split screen, it seems to me like split screen has been more of a after thought, which really disappoints me because split screen is what half of these party games are. 

[h1] TLDR: [/h1]
if you didn't want to read me ranting, basically Party Animals is a phenomenal game help back by weird design choices like not being able to queue for certain game modes, not being able to play offline, a messy split screen, and excessive micro transactions. If they got these things fixed (which I highly doubt for the micro transactions) then this game would be a ten out of ten for me, but how it is now I can't rate it higher than a six out of ten.

146687833,english,"I have previously made a negative vote on party animals, the result is still the same, I still would give it a negative review, but, the reasoning has changed a lot. Before my biggest complains were as such: 1, no oceanic servers, 2: no solo mode, only team modes, and dependence on teammates, 3: Micro transactions. Now, after around 2 months of new patches, updates, etc, I will now say the game is in a better place than it was, but still suffering in many different categories. They have now added oceanic servers, allowing austrailians to finally play the game without being at such a massive disadvantage you may as well not even play, but, there is still expensive micro transactions, and there is still no solo mode. Again, only team modes makes it so if your teammate or teammate's are bad, or inexperianced, or AFK, etc, you will have a big disadvantage that is detrimental to the point of winning because you were the better player; it is sometimes similar to rolling dice, hoping for a good roll, hence, good teammates that will actually be good, and not throw the game. I would really like to see a solo mode, and honestly, once they do release a solo mode, I will likely come back to this review again, to change it to a probable positive review. Like I said before, the game has improved with many patches, and updates, giving new mechanics, a new map, more skins, challanges, more regions, etc, but, there is still the big problem of micro transactions and only team mode games. Micro transactions are typically seen in primarily free to play games, such as fortnite, and COD warzone, and various other free to play games. But, party animals is normally around 20$ US dollars, for the standard edition. But, the dev's still decided they needed many bullshit microtransactions that are just as much money, to buy the game, as to get 2 lame, boring legendary skins.

146687229,english,"Game is just as fun as it was during the 2020 demo, I've experienced no issues with the servers (East Coast USA for reference), playing offline doesn't apply to me or most people on Steam because couch co-op basically died 10 years ago. That being said, if you want to make a custom game and have everybody on the same machine, I'm sure you can absolutely do that.

Game is a blast, I'm laughing my ass off every time I start up a match (which took like 5 seconds to queue, there's no ten minute wait times that I've seen some people claim). The micro transactions (literally all cosmetics, nothing game changing) aren't really that egregious, you can earn both forms of currency by just playing the game and leveling up so you can achieve most of, if not all the content the game has to offer without spending more than the game's asking price.

Finally getting around to release and is still just as fun. I was a bit worried about the amount of content due to all the different levels in the game, but I am happily surprised by the amount of levels that have been added to the final game. They have bunches of team objective games, and last-man standing. The different gamemodes and level hazards really creates many unique interactions. And its all in a physics game which I am very fond of all the floppiness of the characters.

The cons of the game are some expensive costumes in the game. There are two separate currencies, Cookies which are earned by playing the game, and Nemo Bucks which are premium currency which are sometimes rewards for leveling up or by purchasing it in-game. Cookies can get you some nice looking costumes, but the sleek and shiny costumes are usually locked behind Nemo Bucks. The only other issue I have with the game is that it can be very easy to start being a sweaty player and KOing people in the first few seconds of the round. Leaving you to spectate for up to a few minutes depending on the map. But you can sometimes avoid this by playing defensively with rolls or running away at round-start.

It's like Gang Beasts with more technical oomph behind it and much better visuals, makes others in the ""Ragdoll brawler"" genre seem obsolete in comparison. 

I've originally played this during Steam's Game Festival in 2020 and it's exactly what I signed up and have been waiting for.
[list]
[*] More maps, 
[*] handfuls of different game-modes and 
[*] a ton of characters. 

[/list]
[h2] The item-shop [/h2] is a particularly greedy move in concept, but ""Out The Box"", my array of critters was pretty sizable. A selection so large I doubt anyone would reasonably be dissatisfied. 

[i] Sharks to pigs to moose to bears to cats, Look at that! [/i] [b] You begin with at least 20+ animals available to you.[/b] unfortunately though, [spoiler]similar to me while writing this review[/spoiler] 
[b] they will be naked; As God intended. [/b] 

But should you wish to adorn your animal with fashionable swag in contempt of nature, You have 3 options currently: [olist] 

[*] Level up to earn ""tokens"" 
[*] Complete Achievements/Challenges for Currency or 
[*] Buy currency ($1 per lootbox, $8 per two costumes in a bundle).
[b] Personally, [/b] I don't care, because the animals aren't paywalled and that's what really matters, that I didn't have to pay to become a Hammerhead shark and headbutt people off a jungle bridge.

[h3] Game has a lot of soul and flavor to it, [/h3] You can at least tell the 3 years of extended development went somewhere.
I think anyone can pick this up, find their favorite animal, discover their favorite map and have a lot of fun in it every so often. 

[h3] Things I feel they can improve on [/h3]
* Cheaper entry price ($15) & 
* Rework Safe Capture. 
Because modes that solely involve wrestling items out of a dogpile of animals with everybody stagnating, holding grab for minutes on end feels developmentally shortsighted, The novelty of it reflects poorly on the overall game when given the same spotlight as the ""primary"", [b] BETTER [/b] brawling modes.

Pros
- Fun, hectic and cute game. It reminds me of Gang Beast.
- A lot going on in every game. One minute you could be walking and the next you're getting tasered or smacked by a lolipop
- Great game with friends
- Great game to make friends

Cons
- Gameplay can seem a little weird or choppy at first because of the movement system
- No offline mode
- Skins can cost upwards towards 30$++ dollars (Doesn't make sense for a game that isn't F2P, should be easier to get skins)

However being in a group of 3-4 players doesn't always mean you will be on the same team as some maps feature 2v2v2v2 survival gameplay which will move one or two people from your group into another team.

1. Create a room
2. Hook up another controller
3. Add bots and close the remaining slots so no one gets in

THAT'S IT! EASY!

1. Purely cosmetic. That's it.
2. 70% of cosmetics you can buy with Cookies. FREE FREE FREE

In in game, you will shown 2 currency, Cookie and Nemo Buck. Cookie can be earn by simply playing the game, while Nemo Buck is premium currency you will get as reward of certain event in the game or in the community, but mostly through exchanging with real money to Nemo Buck. With those currency you can buy variety of costumes available in the shop and the stock of said costumes will change after a certain time.

The costumes are devided into several grade, from common to legendary. The sad part is, 1 legendary costume in the shop cost you USD$ 22.4, while other legendary costumes can be accuire through gacha along with other lesser grade costumes, with some luck of course. Fortunately, there is some safety feature in gacha like pity sistem, it's sure 1 random legendary costume at 70 pull or 8400 Nemo Buck (USD$ 63). If you still do not get the legendary costume you want, there is sure egg mechanic, which you will get after pulling 2 legendary costume. And the legendary costume will not repeat until you collect all the legendary costumes from gacha machine, while other lesser grade will repeat and exchage to cookie if you got the second time.

-3 Year wait had 0 communication on what they were adding to the game. Dev team always stayed silent when asked about a release date, what they're adding, what they plan to add, etc... Just ignored the playerbase.
-FFA removal. All games are either in duos or full teams.
-Pricey skins that basically just add a hat or a shirt.

For some of the negative comments
This is simply an expression of my own opinion
So far, with the time spent on previous tests
I've played the game for about 10 hours
I myself like this game
Although it still has a few minor flaws
I'd like to talk about the advantages of Party Animals first.
-
1. The simulation of the character's movement is very good.
I like the simulation of the character's movement.
And the overall style of the game is cozy and cute
There are a lot of characters in the game.
You can unlock them as long as you have a skin.
2. in terms of game map and gameplay
Some of the Survival maps have their own characteristics.
The team scoring gameplay has some different gameplay experiences.
3. There are a lot of small details in the game team that should be encouraged.
For example, in order to make the waiting process not boring.
Added some ways to interact with each other
There are also ways to interact with the game UI on the fitting side.
4. the game pass is free of charge, which may be due to the game's buyout system.
5. There are no bugs in the game so far.
There are no plug-in players.
The matching speed is also very fast
However, I'm not sure if there will be any in the future, we can still wait and see.
6. The official forum has been set up for everyone to express their opinions and give feedback.
- 
Next, I'll talk about the shortcomings that I see after the pros.
1. The game is a bit expensive at over 400 NT dollars.
But you can see the care of the production team.
I hope there will be more updates in the future.
2. You do need to wait for some time on the first day.
And that time is not according to the order of logging in.
Like I waited for about an hour and a half 
My brother logged in slower than me, but it only took 3 minutes.
3. The money in the store is very expensive.
It's like buying a deluxe pass.
I can't buy the Epic or above.
The free money in the pass is also less.
4. It's hard to add friends to the system.
5. Twister coins can't be purchased or exchanged with in-game currency.
These are the pros and cons that I can think of so far.
For your reference, there's still room for improvement.
But overall, I'd give it an 8 out of 10.
The game experience and style are very much to my liking.
As for the price, I think it might be adjusted later.
I just hope he won't be invaded by game cheaters.

對於某些負面評論來說
這裡單純表達自己的看法
目前加上以往測試的時間
大約遊玩了10小時左右
我自己本身是喜歡這個遊戲的
雖然他還是有幾個小缺點
想先說一下Party Animals的優點
-
1. 對於角色的動作模擬非常到位
很喜歡角色模擬的動作表現
且遊戲風格整體舒適可愛
遊戲角色也很多
只要擁有造型就可以解鎖
2. 在遊戲地圖與玩法上
某些生存賽地圖都有各自的特色
在團隊得分玩法上也有一些不同的遊戲體驗
3.遊戲團隊當中有很多小細節值得鼓勵
像是為了讓等待過程中不無聊
增加了一些可以互動的方式
還有試穿那邊也可以與遊戲UI互動
4. 遊戲通行證為免費 也有可能是因為遊戲買斷制
所以當中才將遊戲通行證設定為免費
5.目前在遊玩過程沒有遇到BUG
也沒有外掛玩家的存在
配對速度也很快
不過之後不確定會不會有 還可以觀望
6.官方有設立論壇供大家發表意見討論與回饋
-
接下來優點說完要說一下我看到的缺點
1.遊戲以目前400多來說確實有點小貴
不過可以看到製作團隊的細心
希望之後會有更多的更新
2.第一天確實需要等上一些時間
且那個時間並不是依照登入的先後順序
像我等了一小時半左右 
我哥比我慢登入卻只需要三分鐘
3.商店內的鈔票造型很貴
像是買了豪華通行證之後
卻無法購買史詩以上的造型
通行證贈送的鈔票也比較少
4.好友系統較難添加
5.扭蛋幣無法透過遊戲幣購買或兌換
目前大概想到了這些優點與缺點
大家可以參考參考 確實還有進步的空間
不過整體下來10分我會給8分
遊戲體驗與風格都很對我的口味
在價格方面感覺之後有可能會調整

Okay on a serious note it makes no sense why offline mode is a make or break for any of you when you clearly have internet and can play with an online connection, you're even using internet to review. I get that the devs worded a section of their description poorly but it really isn't that deep. You're review bombing a good game for literally no good reason, this is better than 90% of the garbage that releases anymore.

Pros:

Maps. I played 2 of the three playtests and I'm back to play the final release! There are a lot of maps (about 20) which all have a unique feature about them and they are all so much fun!

Gameplay. It's a combination of rubber bandits and gang beasts, which are my favorite party games. And it's great! You can punch, kick, dropkick, headbutt, swim, and climb, plus there are plenty of weapons!

Characters. You can't deny they are awesome! I love the selection of animals and all of the different outfits, much better than most party games.

Progression. The rewards from progressing through the game are great. You are able to earn all of the currencies through leveling up which is not very common in games nowdays! Ot definitely feels rewarding to play.

Compatibility. Just wanted to mention that I appreciate the devs supporting the Stean Deck, and it runs pretty well!

Cons:

Offline play. Many people were disappointed that offline mode isn't in the game, but that wasn't my main reason to buy the game. Though, I do feel like it needs to be added as it seems essential for any party game.

Pricing. It's just too much. As mentioned earlier, you can earn currency through progression, which is good. But, if you want to get a legendary outfit out of the store, that's 3000 Nemo Bucks!! 3000 Nemo Bucks costs about $23! That's waaaaay overpriced for one outfit. At the same time though, some outfits are fine, like only 120 Nemo Bucks.

146675709,english,"Sorry, but no.  The game is really fun and cute, but the monetization is scummy and evil.

Party Animals uses all the tricks in the book like FOMO (timed store), gambling addiction (loot boxes), and multiple forms of currency to maximize confusion.  The gacha mechanics are especially bad.  You can get duplicates which pay out measly amounts of the lesser in-game currency.  I've bought about 20 of these gacha items and half of them were duplicates, so the odds are stacked against you.

The forced always online DRM is purely to support these unlockables.

The game also has some unfair maps.  For example, in Trebuchet you're more likely to be thrown in the water next to the clearing.  One team's clearing is on the north and the other on the south.  Since the water only flows in one direction, one team has a chance to recover after being thrown in the water while the other team is swept away quickly.

It's a real shame.  Party Animals should have been the next Gang Beasts.",1695251272,1695308315,FALSE,3,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198024928793,0,119,1221,2,35,1706226480

146675466,english,"I do not understand why this game has mixed reviews, it's a fantastic game. 

Positives:

1. Plenty of maps and game modes to play.
2. Can play with friends/family privately.
3. If you do not like the pvp aspect of Party Animals, you can host a custom match and make it private, you can fight against AI on any difficulty. NOTE: Playing against AI and finishing matches barely gain you XP to level up.

Negatives:

1. In app purchases to pay real money to get new things, or in-game money you gain to get new things without paying actual money. Those 2 are separate, cookies (in-game money/not real money), and nemo bucks (real money). Cookies you use them on unlocks without paying real money and nemo bucks you pay for unlocks with actual paid money.
2. As mentioned in positive number 3 above, you only gain more XP in pvp mode to level up, not against AI.
3. No offline/LAN mode to play on, only online but to put it this way, to even play together, you need internet anyway, not sure actually, I may be wrong there.
4. A gambling system to get new unlocks if you don't want to pay real money to unlock things but it costs stuff.

Party Animals is a hilarious game and is fun as heck, get it, see if you like. I love it so much. Gives me a good laugh every time.

IMPORTANT: Read below...

For those that have friends and family to play with in private matches, you will gain more XP depending on how many players there are to level up faster. If you are playing against random players in public matches or quick matches, you gain even more XP as far as I'm concerned. 

That is all, have fun and let the hunger/fluffy games begin!

I don't even care about losing a match. It's too silly to get upset at. 8.5/10 - Looks like you can earn a bunch of the paid currency through the progress line.

Honestly, most are probably children coming off Gang Beasts, which uses a similar control scheme but is different enough that it requires just a little bit more practice to really get the hang of it.

The game runs smoothly. Two trains are barreling down the tracks, two teams of Red and Blue trying to stuff coal from one end of their train to the front with the engine. I'm working hard, tossing coal, when suddenly a Blue enemy jumps across the trains to board ours. He's got nunchucks, and he's a fierce little goose animal. He's whacking the dog-poop out of... I guess what literally are the doggy characters. 

I jump across like he did. I dropkick a Gorilla off the train, then I punch another Gorilla into the engine of their own train and he explodes into dust. I grab the handle next to their engine and it starts to slow them down. We end up winning, and on the final picture, I am punched in the snout and am two feet in the air when the snapshot is taken.

Good game. It's enjoyable and besides the really exorbitant prices for some of the cosmetics, which do make you look pretty cool, I'm excited to see where this game goes.

Yes, you can create a custom game with friends online and add up to 4 players on your device. Meaning if you have a friend next to you, they can play with your online friends too.
There are also two currencies one that you can pay with real money and one that you can earn by playing. But as you level up they reward you with both of it. So I'm pretty confused about those critics ? Skins is really not a new concept.

146674017,english,"A Long Wait in Vain: My Disappointing Journey with Party Animals

As a dedicated gamer, I've eagerly anticipated the release of ""Party Animals"" for what felt like an eternity. With teasers and promises swirling around for three long years, my excitement knew no bounds. The premise of adorable animals duking it out in chaotic party games seemed like a recipe for endless entertainment. Sadly, after finally getting my hands on the game, my hopes came crashing down in disappointment.

The initial charm of Party Animals cannot be denied. Its cute, cuddly characters and whimsical arenas instantly put a smile on your face. From cats to dogs to bunnies, each furry contestant has its own unique appeal, and the game's colorful aesthetics are a visual treat. However, beyond the surface, the game begins to unravel.

One of the most glaring issues is the lack of content. After three years of development, one would expect a plethora of mini-games, arenas, and customization options. Instead, Party Animals offers a disappointingly small selection of mini games that grow stale far too quickly. The handful of arenas feels like a missed opportunity for diverse and exciting settings for these animal brawls. There's a stark absence of a compelling single-player experience, leaving solo players with nothing but an empty party.

Party Animals also disappoints in terms of longevity. With such a limited selection of games and lackluster mechanics, the game's replayability quickly dwindles. After a few hours of play, it's challenging to find motivation to return to the same handful of minigames.

Even more disheartening is the missed opportunity for online play. Given Party Animals' potential for raucous multiplayer fun, the omission of robust online features is a letdown. The absence of competitive modes and leaderboards leaves players with little incentive to engage with the game beyond the occasional couch co-op session with friends.

It's worth noting that Party Animals could have been a vastly different experience if the developers had taken the time to listen to player feedback during its three-year development cycle. However, it appears that the game was rushed to release without addressing these fundamental issues.

In conclusion, ""Party Animals"" was a game I waited three long years for, hoping for a fantastic party game experience. Sadly, it failed to live up to the lofty expectations it had set. The lack of content, uninspired gameplay, and absence of online features make it a game that quickly loses its charm. It's a reminder that hype can sometimes lead to crushing disappointment, and in the case of Party Animals, the wait was ultimately in vain.

Full review:
The game is fun and well-optimized, runs well on a Steam deck, and 20 and 40 series of RTX cards, making it an overall good experience. Demand for offline local op is a valid request, but not a negative review worthy of it. The game has one quick play mode, which allows you to play online with other players; there are  20 maps divided into a few modes; and a second custom mode, which gives you the ability to play any map with friends online. There are no major game-breaking bugs. As for micro-transactions, the game has micro-transactions, but they are purely cosmetic and provide no advantage. The game has three different currencies: cookies, Nemo bucks, and coins. Cookies are the free currency that you earn by playing the game and leveling up, which can be used to buy skins in the shop. Nemo Bucks are the premium currency that you buy with real money to buy skins. Nemo bucks can also be used to convert to cookies or gold coins.  Gold coins have so far been used in the Gacha loot box to get skins at random. You can also earn premium currency, Nemo bucks and coins, which you stop earning after reaching level 100 as of writing this review.",1695244042,1695244042,TRUE,1,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198193947325,271,12,767,0,86,1703215529

146670227,english,"The game is an absolute blast but the negative reviews are trying to bring it down.

IN-GAME CURRENCY:
Yes there are microtransactions however both can be earned in-game via leveling up (playing the actual game). They are a small indie game dev and the microtransactions are just there to 1. help them grow and continue to make the game 2. if you want to grab a premium skin quicker.

GACHA LOOT SYSTEM:
The slot machine for getting other skins is there but again the premium currency used for it can be earned fairly easily. you get a minimum of 200 Nemo bucks when you level up at certain points and it costs 120 Nemo bucks to use the slot machine. During the play tests, i was able to unlock a TON of skins via achievements, slot machine, and the shop without paying extra.

MORE SERVERS:
Again its a small indie dev company and its their first game (from what I've seen at least). The probably had a smaller budget than most and wanted to get the biggest servers up and running first.

QUEUE TIMES:
This is unintentional. If you are having 10min queue times they had said that you just need to restart the game and it should be fine. Most queue times are probably 5-10 seconds.

OFFLINE PLAY:
Its unfortunate that you need wifi to play the game yes. It was promised on release and they may or may not have lied about it meaning split-screen and not offline play. I.E. (quote from discord) 

""However, it seems this statement led some players to believe that Party Animals supports an offline mode. We regret the misunderstanding and wish to clarify that the game does not have, nor do we plan to introduce an offline mode. Party Animals currently requires an online connection to play.""

I hope they change their mind about not making an offline mode in the near future...

Overall the game is very fun and I got quite a few good laughs from it. The physics are just great

In summary, this is just a fun casual game. I won't go into the game's details because the game is so basic that watching any gameplay of this game will let you know everything the game is about. I just want to address the two primary issues about why the game is getting the reaction that it's getting, and why it's being review bombed.

[hr][/hr]
[h3]Issue #1[/h3]
The game's store page from when the game was first put up on Steam all the way up until a few hours after it's official launch, stated that you could play with your friends online or with offline split screen.  [b]However, the game is an always online game, and there is no offline functionality.[/b] They have since changed the wording of this on the store page and stated that it stemmed from miscommunication partly due to a translation issue, as English is not the studio's native language. 

You can still play split-screen mode with people locally, but you have to make a private lobby to do so. You can still invite friends online to connect to the private lobby you're playing split-screen in, but currently, playing split screen multiplayer is not available in public lobbies via online matchmaking.

[hr][/hr]
[h3]Issue #2[/h3]
There is an in-game store to unlock different animals and costumes, which has a daily and weekly rotation. There are two forms of currency: Nemo Bucks and Cookies. Some costumes cost Nemo Bucks, while some cost Cookies. Both of these can be obtained through playing the game and leveling up your ""Animal Level"" (i.e. Profile level). However, you get Cookies at an increased rate compared to Nemo Bucks, and once you reach the Level Cap of 100, the only reward you get is Cookies from then onwards. 

Due to this, Nemo Bucks can be considered the ""Premium"" currency of the game. You can pay real money to get more Nemo Bucks, and you're also able to convert Nemo Bucks into Cookies, but not vice versa. As such, you could view Party Animals as a free-to-play game masquerading as a paid game, and you already have a premium pass to gain a decent chunk of that Premium currency (provided you level up).

There's zero option to convert any of your hard work via the earnable currency into the paid one which just leaves an unfair uphill grind for you to tolerate or give into buy purchasing an overpriced currency pack.

I pre-ordered this game and participated in the playtest and had a blast, it's incredibly fun with friends and is a great physics-based party game. However, I couldn't help but notice that most of the game's modes that weren't present within the playtest are all very similar with only minor gimmick changes so that was pretty disappointing.

I can overlook the ""translation error"" on their part too, but if it really was a mistake why would you go out of your way to silence people for it? Even if it was an error, it was your error and you had months to correct it seeing as the game's steam page has been live for a good while now.

At the end of the day, the game is great, but it launched with so many red flags and greedy practices that I'm no longer interested in supporting them.

It's an incredibly chaotic and fun casual game, with a lot of variety in maps and game modes. In one, two teams will be on two trains and you have to deliver coal to speed yourself up and make it to the goal before the other, while simultaneously committing sabotage on the other train by pulling the breaks. Another will have you and a buddy on a continuously breaking iceberg which you must try your best to stay on lest the ice cold waters take you.

Another nice thing is in the last stand modes (where you try to outlast everyone else amidst a crumbling stage) is that you will always have a partner so even if you get eliminated soon into the round, you still have a chance of winning. Better still when you are dead, you can still effect the match by throwing fish, bananas and bombs which helps a lot in making falling off a stage feel less bad.

146668819,english,"Note #3: will edit again, but to keep it short, I've discovered custom matches only award you a quarter of what quick matches do for winning. Will reflect this proper in review. It is apparent that earning only 1 xp in custom matches on release [b]seems[/b] to have been a bug, and I appreciate the developers fixing that.

Speaking from the perspective of someone who wanted the game solely to play custom matches with friends.

Started playing second playtest, was awesome, wasn't even aware of an XP cap on custom games because it was so lenient.

Third playtest, hit the cap in less than an hour of play. Okay, a little fair, can't have people grinding premium cosmetics with bots, but still. Gave feedback requesting that it should be increased, or that we should receive a % less once the daily limit is hit, until it's reset.

Boot up the game today to see what's happened, earned exactly 1 XP for a match by myself, based on ""game time"". Later I would see the same thing happen when playing with a friend locally, no matter how long our match lasted. What on earth. It's possible to earn XP with one other online player in your lobby, albeit much less than we ever earned during playtests, so it's still far from ideal.

While cosmetics are not everything, to be able to earn fair progression by playing with friends is all I ever originally asked for. I tried quick matches, and it was awful; everyone was sweating for achievements and/or xp, and i suspect it will only get much, much worse now that custom matches are no longer an option (unless you want to play literal thousands of matches to progress *one* level). Not me, not my friends, not anybody should be walled off from progressing in a party game because we decide how we want to have fun with it.

The microtransactions are frankly egregious, and initially I excused it because it wouldn't be that hard to earn them with xp, even with the third playtest's crappy daily cap. Now? Money is the only way for me & others who refuse quick matches, and I'm not very inclined to spend anything further after the game's turning out on release day.

And there's the fact that the game is online-only, which is pretty silly for a party game. While the team is chalking it up to a misinterpretation due to translation, and that could very well be the truth, I'm not sure. There had to be time to make this very clear to the players, especially considering the practice of online-only games has gained infamy for its use.

Please make it so that people can actually earn XP/earn a decent amount of XP from custom games again. What took a few hours of play over the course of 2 days during Playtest #2 to get to Level 26 has already been a crawl in comparison over 3; currently just hit Level 20. 

While I understand offline mode won't come in a day, that would be great, too.

When I first played the game in 2020, I saw it as the new Gang Beasts, because said game managed to be ruined from the alpha days leading up to final release, and I thought Party Animals would be an exception. I hoped it would not become the same story, but here we are. Although I am certainly enjoying the core gameplay--it is much more fun than Gang Beasts was on retail release--I cannot recommend anyone buy this game in its current state, until, at the very least, the grievances about micros & XP gain are fixed.

146668141,english,"Solid game played it for many hours before on the play test its the next step for the Gang beastian genre. Including a ton of maps, Items, game modes and it can be played with up to 8 players. You can punch, kick, headbutt, Jump into a drop kick, run into a heavy punch, dodge roll, or even throw items or other players the list of action and interactivity is vast far more then other party games.

There was some initial confusion with the description but anyone who played the play test knew from seeing what they were doing they were doing a live service model which I know for a fact can rub some the wrong way. But games like this benefit greatly from such a model because it lets them stream constant ebb and flow of content so the game can keep providing it.

To clarify this whole monetization system its completely optional the only thing you can get out of it is cosmetics think KF2 another popular and successful live service game its the same deal here. Except its 100% cosmetics people complain about MTXs in payed for games but if it serves a not functional purpose and is 100% optional then I kind of have to discount such a complaint. Morally dubious at worst but just a thing you can dismiss at best also even someone who is not paying can get some of these cosmetics for themselves its not 100% locked out to you as quite a lot are unlocked via free gains and achievements. So MTXs really only apply to 33 to 50% of the entire cosmetic selection yes Nemo bucks are a limited premium currency but you do gain some from leveling up and some free spins on this games loot box mechanic so you can get some of that exclusive catalog without paying.

So your money goes to actually having access to playing the full game front to back and what it has the MTXs are optional cosmetics and this being live service at least for now there is no offline for now anyways but on the flip side you have cross play so its kind of a double edged sword. So this MTX angry bus the small group I call who complain about MTXs to any capacity in games to counter them I argue while it has gotten bad in other games here this is nothing in comparison to what they could be doing.

I have most of the cosmetics I want sans like one or 2 that I dont really need and I didn't pay a cent on MTXs I will say some of the Nemo Bucks skins on the store imo are ludicrously expensive. I will give the angry bus that but you could also just not buy them because its not stopping you from playing the game you payed for.

Overall dont take the Offline only and MTX haters as proof if you played Gang Beasts and have a friend who has any of the supported platforms and a decent internet connection at least for now until the devs add a offline mode which could happen given live service guarantees long term support for the game if its done right. If we preach are wants on it loud enough I am sure it can come to fruition after all other live service games have done it so in any case yha its a 8/10 its a amazing party game if you can get past the fact its a live service with the baggage that entails.",1695240308,1695240308,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198042231954,279,40,147,0,128,1695271911

Our intention with th sentence ""Paw it out with your friends both online and offline."" was to convey that you can play with your friends remotely (online), or together in the same location using the same device (offline) through split-screen.

Our intention with th sentence ""Paw it out with your friends both online and offline."" was to convey that you can play with your friends remotely (online), or together in the same location using the same device (offline) through split-screen.

We sincerely apologize for any confusion our wording caused. It was never our intention to mislead our player base about the availability of an offline mode.

The game did not feature an offline mode in the recent three rounds of playtesting either. Intentionally misleading our players while conducting playtests that clearly reveal the absence of an offline mode would be nonsensical. (We admit, however, that our description could have been more thoughtfully worded...)

Regarding skins to Animals. There are skins that you can buy for money and in-game currency. Of course better looking ones are for cash, but who's care? Company have to earn money somehow.

And with enough criticism I'm sure it will be added but outright boycotting the developers, and thereby preventing them from having the funds TO fix the problem isn't helping.

The game is fun, it can start and end friendships in less than 10 minutes. And if you're anything like me and found it interesting because of gang beasts,

They are not even in the same lane, more maps, more gamemodes, AND WEAPONS. The ocassional slow down on big meaty hits makes the game very satisfying. While I do wish we had the ability to control each arm individually like in gang beasts I'm glad it didn't just copy and paste its control scheme and gameplay outright.

rounds never drag on too long as most maps have stage hazards that slowly make it harder to survive.

Server issues right off the bat are almost a given in any game, but those have been mostly cleared up at least in NA servers. This games servers are NUTS. You have to have some remarkably bad internet to have enough network problems in this game to make it outright unplayable.

Its FUN, and between drops and leveling up you do NOT have to engage with its microtransactions if you do not wish too,

And again with enough criticism I'm sure they will add a way to convert cookies into Nemo bucks, or provide some way for players to continuously earn nemo bucks even after reaching level 100.

Play the game, support the developers but make sure your complaints are still heard and valid.

Also, filled to the brim with predatory micro transactions, with the cost of some character skins being double the price of the game itself ($40).

If you have children, go buy GANG BEASTS instead. this was a major let down. The devs need to fix this ASAP.

Moderators are also deleting posts criticizing the game, which is a major red flag.

If you're concerned for the reviews, the game is being reviewbombed for very unfair reasons that have already been clarified by the devs over at their discord. The game initially had a description on the steam page that mentioned the ability to play offline. There is still local split screen but never was the game intended to be played fully offline (since y'know, it's a multiplayer game).

I'll leave the official note from the devs down here:
[i]
We have received feedback about some confusion regarding our game description.

Here is the original version of the game description online:

[b]Fight your friends as puppies, kittens, and other fuzzy creatures in PARTY ANIMALS! Paw it out with your friends both online and offline. Interact with the world under our realistic physics engine. Did I mention PUPPIES?[/b]

The phrase raising concerns is:

Paw it out with your friends both online and offline.

Our intention with this sentence was to convey that you can play with your friends remotely (online), or together in the same location using the same device (offline) through split-screen.
[u]However, it seems this statement led some players to believe that Party Animals supports an offline mode. We regret the misunderstanding and wish to clarify that the game does not have, nor do we plan to introduce, an offline mode. Party Animals currently requires an online connection to play.[/u][/i]

It feels so smooth and it’s sooo much fun! Every map, so far not even tested all, have there own style an like some specials about.
You battle for some powerful items, and knock people out with some random physics going on, which is also pretty unpredictable and fun.
In most of the Team games you have to work together, pass the ball, manipulate the enemy team, or be the goalkeeper and not rush the ball. 
The animals are cute and this game is very easy for beginners. It’s not like you need to figure out long, what to do. And from time to time you learn some new great moves or tricks which maybe improve your gameplay. 

[h3]Menu/Transactions[/h3]
The Menu is clean, not overloaded. So fits the music, well chosen. 
I don’t really understand why people hate these micro transactions. Sure you can buy some skins for like 20$, but you don’t have to. It’s not like people, that are are buying cosmetics have powerful punches or stuff. It’s just cosmetic. If you play you also get both currency during the playtime/Leveling up. So you get some cool cosmetics or can spare some and get the one expensive you want. Or you complete challenges to unlock some cosmetics. 

[h3]Servers[/h3]
I know there are no OCE Servers, but I speak here for the European. Sure, at the start were some issues. 10+ mins queue’s. But they fix this quite fast, so now you get matches in like 5-10 seconds. I haven’t got any disconnects through the matches, or anything seems laggy. So everything is fine!

Even though you can have custom games with bots, I get why that could be an issue - since the game description was obviously changed last-minute before release.

Matchmaking issues (and no Oceanic servers apparently) I can understand as it's just been released. I can guarantee from the sheer amount of people talking about it that (HOPEFULLY) they'll fix those issues. 

Other than that the amount of polish done to this game is honestly incredible, compared to almost every other company with that same 3yr time frame: The UI has been improved; the new gameplay mechanics; the new maps; even the fact that you can give yourself a nickname ON TOP of your gamertag that other people see instead in online matches!

Our intention with th sentence ""Paw it out with your friends both online and offline."" was to convey that you can play with your friends remotely (online), or together in the same location using the same device (offline) through split-screen.

We sincerely apologize for any confusion our wording caused. It was never our intention to mislead our player base about the availability of an offline mode.

The game did not feature an offline mode in the recent three rounds of playtesting either. Intentionally misleading our players while conducting playtests that clearly reveal the absence of an offline mode would be nonsensical. (We admit, however, that our description could have been more thoughtfully worded...)

146662039,english,"Party animal is a small improvement over the 2017’s “gang beast” formula
While I really like the gameplay and have fun smashing random cute animals and giggle like a school girl when I see my favorite animal in a cute costume, my review has to be objective and negative for now, simply because reviews is the only thing developers might listen to.

So, what’s the problem?
Well for starters the game went back on a core promise they made 3 years ago. Unlike gang beast that released in 2017, there is no local coop, no couch coop, no lobby creation, just singleplayer matchmaking.
Why is that a problem? Well a few hours ago AFTER RELEASE AND PLAYTEST, they changed the steam description of the game from ""Paw it out with your friends both online and offline"" to not include the word offline anymore. This is a similar behavior to what unity did a couple days ago changing their contract and removing their database to hide their change in decision. (Check steamdb if you don’t believe me)

This is a problem for me, this is marketed as a party game that is unplayable as a party game :
->I wanted to play the game on split screen with my friends, now this is not possible.
->I can’t play the game offline on holydays or in the car/train/bus with friends because this is online and singleplayer only.
This problem is even exacerbated because choosing your prefered server is bugged and you're stuck on whatever server above 120 ms they chose for you so enjoy having a 1-2 second lag on everything you do.

Now, what could be the reason of such a decision?
That’s right, it’s money, it’s always money.

- Above the fact that you then need to buy multiple copies (and screens) to be able to use this game as a party game, the game includes a always online status to promote a predatory gacha system similar to what gacha games like Genshin offers, in fact the odds are very similar: You like that legendary skin on the corgi? Well though luck mate, you’re gonna have to use the gacha egg system and count on a 1.5% chance of obtaining it (1 chance out of ~700 pulls), to guarantee a legendary a post calculated that you need to invest 250€ into it and even then you could get a different legendary that you can’t or don’t want to use. (Source : https://steamcommunity.com/app/1260320/discussions/2/5291222404442799257/ )

- There is also a rotating shop promoting fomo that puts most skins as “unavailable” to incentivise you to log in every day/week for the privilege of buying it or really make you feel like you should be buying this other cute skin before it goes away.
->This is bad because this is like that for 70% of skins
->This is bad because it’s a 17,99€ pay to play game 
->This is bad because this is marketed at kids and kids and even some adults are very well manipulated by gambling practices that maybe they won’t find horrible because they were born after things like that became the norm and this shouldn’t be the norm.
->This is bad because it weaponizes our love and bias for adorable animals for corporate profit.

Again, the game is fine and is good mindless fun just like gang beast was in 2017 but in the current state I don’t feel like you should support it, I don’t know why they needed 3 years to finish development when the game feels like the exact same it was on the October 2019 playtest that I participated in (making the perfect system to squeeze as much money from their customers as possible perhaps) but whatever really, fix your predatory monetisation, keep promises you made years ago and I will change my review for a positive one. I know I’m gonna receive hate from people that are just blind to those problems because they enjoy the cuteness of the game, I choose to be objective and speak up to promote a gaming economy that don’t use psychology tricks to make a ton of money on your vulnerabilities and affection for cute animals",1695232807,1695233315,FALSE,24,1,0.582012653,3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561197992873273,342,77,1111,0,30,1701574657
146662001,english,"Game is fun (esp with friends). 
There's different objectives in different maps. Be it BR like shrinking zone elimination matches, soccer like games, CTF, etc.

Servers do have some issues. In some servers there's stuttering every other second. 
Moreover leaving such server results in a temp ban from matchmaking (even if it's the first time you get 2 min ban)
But more than not everything seems to work and the game is good imo.

Another issue right now is that if you want to queue up with 3 friends, you can get game modes that are 2v2v2v2 and one of you will be thrown into a game with random person.

Monetization side? Idk, there's things you can buy with in game currency, there's also premium one that you can buy more ""rare"" costumes and what not.
Didn't really look into the pricing as I don't care for mtx stuff as long as it's not p2w.

[h3] PLEASE DON'T LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS SWAY YOU. [/h3]
It is the first day of launch they are having server issues. It happens. It will be fixed.
[b]While there are valid complaints (which I will mention below) it is good to note that this game [i]is[/i] being review bombed by chinese users (I am not completely savvy to the reason). If you filter reviews by your language you will see a change in average go from mixed to very positive. [h3] 85% positive at time of writing. [/h3] [i]Less than one third[/i] of reviews are in English, that's a huge discrepancy[/b]

[h2] Real Talk [/h2]
As for the cons that hold more water I want to address them so interested people won't be deterred by them at surface level the way the neg reviews present them.

[b]Offline mode: [/b]  valid. if they said it would have it, it should. However, it's not something that can't be added/fixed.  I hope they will. 

[i][b]Update on Offline Mode:[/b] They devs clarified that offline mentioned in their description was meant to mean locally and not offline.  It's unfortunate that those who wanted a internetless way to play aren't able to, however, I think a lot of disgruntled commenters are confusing offline mode with couch-co-op.  You can still play on the same screen together and make it so its a private party of just you guys without matchmaking, or for a better term ""local"" play, which is common in games nowadays. 

It is rare to find party games outside of nintendo that still support offline play and not just local play in 2023 and I can only think of a handful of situations where someone would be wanting to play this without access to the internet. That's not to say there isnt or there aren't people who don't have valid cause to be disappointed, I just don't think its as widespread as the issues with it tend to be. [/i]

[b]Servers:[/b] first day servers are always a bit rough, I trust they will stabilize, but I do feel for countries that do not have a local server causing them to have higher latency connections. However, I trust this is temporary and more will be added.

[b]Micro transactions:[/b]  cosmetic only.  while its not a ftp game for it to include a store like others, the micro transactions are very optional. I do think the prices are steep for a ftp game but you get points for level ups and can earn both the regular and premium currency through playing. Unfortunately right now the means to accrue premium currency via leveling is finite as it caps at lvl 99. Hopefully they add more ways in the future. It's good to note you can also convert one currency into the other for added flexibility [strike](though i do not know if this goes both ways)[/strike]
[i]*see edit below[/i]  

[b][h3]Bottom line is,[/h3] it is a great fun game, and all the potential drawbacks are easily fixable or preference based.  [/b]

[i](also note, I'm not affiliated with the devs, nor did I receive this game for free. I just am very happy to finally have this game and want to clear the air of fear mongering)[/i]

[h3]EDIT:[/h3]
It has been clarified that you can not exchange currency both ways which is unfortunate. I think this would be a good feature to implement as it would take the pressure off some of the more heavy handed microtransactions, because I agree, for a not ftp game, some of these items are expensive.

[b]I also edited the above to reflect their recent statement on the matter[/b]

[i]To the commenters: like I said in the post, they are all valid concerns, i never dismissed that. but they are not ones that are completely gamebreaky to the point of the mass spam of negative reviews that are happening.

-Regular servers are having connection issues, and xbox play pass users have reported issues
-There are microtransactions in this game, however it does not affect gameplay at all as these are skins and completely optional. I'll also add that you can get almost all the animals with the free to earn currency through level ups and achievements, as well as some skins.
-People are talking about an offline mode and I think there was generally some miscommunication here, but I understand the complaints. There is no offline, only online co-op and online couch co-op at the time of this review
So, if these things affect you, especially server concerns, wait a few days for an update on stability.

The devs also have shown themselves to care a lot about making this game better. I'm hopeful that the dev team will take the major criticisms seriously and fix those. Though again, I must point out that the only major criticisms I see are queue times - for an online-only, day 1 release with a ton of people on simultaneously - and the lack of an offline mode - which I agree should be added in.

The gameplay is unanimously enjoyed, but crazy amounts of review bombing from where the Developers are from. If you were to check the reviews for your own languages, you'll notice that the game rating showcases itself as ""Very Positive"" - as shown here: [url=https://i.imgur.com/OVHa3XC.png][/url] If you're wondering what they're complaining about, it's primarily about the pricing in their currency, the time it took to finish development on the game, apparent lies to the Chinese playerbase, and the so called ""lack of content."" Some of these points I cannot attest, but the lack of content, I disagree. Since the content offered is varied and unique. 20 Unique maps, for a similarly priced game to Gang Beasts, which this game takes heavy inspiration to. If the pricing is unfair for the Chinese, then regional pricing does need to be adjusted.[h2]Anyways, what [i]does [/i]the gameplay offer?[/h2]A simple party game beat-em-up, that you knock out your friends or opponents online. Toss them off the edge, or play objective based modes inspired by real sports, or mini-games to work together towards. The maps are all varied and unique in their own right. Unique gimmicks and hazards that gives each maps personality. The controls are easy to pick-up, but may take a couple games to get a hang of. Strong wind-ups of running punches, small jabs, jump kicks, slight kicks, or headbutts that while your character moves like a wobbly drunkard. Not too good at unarmed combat? There are plenty of physical weapons to harness, from ranged to melee: Tasers, crossbows, ice-guns, shovels, lollipops, and more. It's a super casual, extremely satisfying, fun arcade-y fighter. Play with some buds and you will guarantee a blast of laughter and fun.

Maps here provide hazards like a creeping gas, a chilling blizzard, a shaky bridge, a submerging submarine, a strong wind tunnel, chilly waters on a breaking glacier, fear of heights on a Fighter Jet, a gravity defying black hole, or an intensifying wavy floating bridge. All with the general premise of knocking out, and throwing off opponents. Each one gets more and more intense over time, becoming more difficult to recover onto the map.

Knock players out of a cabin into a blizzard, or throw players onto the tracks of an incoming train.[/quote][h1]Comparison to the competition[/h1]In comparison to Gang Beasts, the movement mechanics are much more streamlined and simplified. For example, Climbing is just a combination of two buttons. Grab + Jump while moving in the direction you want to climb towards. Whereas in Gang Beasts, you had to raise your arms, alternating both hands while grabbing, all while holding jump. You basically have to play QWOP in Gang Beasts just to recover after being thrown off. It would be a lot more difficult to master, which seems wrong for a Party Game. In map-design, this game is much more physics-influenced, varied, with accompanying toys/weaponry to play around with. More unique modes, and more ways to play than the alternative. It seems that Party Animals is just an upgrade in every single way.
[h1][b]My qualms[/b][/h1]With the positive, there are always some complaints. They are not enough to deter me into a negative review, but I believe they should be addressed. For the Australian players, there should be provided OCE servers. Offline functionality should be a feature as promised, as this game should not always be online. P2P-Fallback would be nice, if the servers ever did get shut down. The price of cosmetics seem a bit expensive during these hard times, & should be lowered. Also, a gacha system in a paid-game seems odd, and misplaced. In total, you can earn quite a few of the gacha rolls for free, but it is limited. You will only be guaranteed one legendary, [i]IF [/i]you do fully progress and obtain all of the free currency and surprise eggs. That may feel a bit tedious, or long to endure. If it was possible to just earn egg-coins perpetually, with no limit, I would find it quite fair.

 [i]It would seem that most of the negative reviews are not about its gameplay. [/i]Despite any of these problems, I believe the pros heavily outweigh the cons. The game is well enough fun for its price, and has provided me the most amount of joy and laughter that no other party game has come close to.

---------------------------------------------------


It's a fun game. It can be addictive at times, especially if you don't want to bother playing other games. 

However, the controls are not that good. The hits don't register properly, everyone is flopping around.

There is no way to recover after being knocked down, regardless of your stamina bar. You can mash all the buttons on your keyboard, but it really depends. It becomes frustrating to deal with these mechanics at some point.

Some of the maps are also too small and badly designed (Gator Valley, Typhoon). Quick deaths are happening, without there being a very clear reason why, especially on maps with various elements (Ichiban, Ice Breaker). Two players fall down, at the same time, but somehow one freezes, or drowns or gets poisoned faster. Last remaining players all die, but there is no draw, one player manages to win in some way.

The camera is not properly angled, and you cannot really change it.

The force quit punish is nonsensical.

Two player splitscreen looks terrible.

The worst of it all, a Gacha type system in a children's game, on top of all the micro-transactions. It's awful.

Insane monetization, some skins cost more than the game itself.

As for the oceanic servers, there at least seems to be something being done about that.


I'll update my review to positive once the devs address these issues.[/strike]

The devs have made a statement about the false advertisement, being a case of miscommunication.

Our intention with th sentence ""Paw it out with your friends both online and offline."" was to convey that you can play with your friends remotely (online), or together in the same location using the same device (offline) through split-screen.

We sincerely apologize for any confusion our wording caused. It was never our intention to mislead our player base about the availability of an offline mode.

The game did not feature an offline mode in the recent three rounds of playtesting either. Intentionally misleading our players while conducting playtests that clearly reveal the absence of an offline mode would be nonsensical. (We admit, however, that our description could have been more thoughtfully worded...)

Our intention with th sentence ""Paw it out with your friends both online and offline."" was to convey that you can play with your friends remotely (online), or together in the same location using the same device (offline) through split-screen.

We sincerely apologize for any confusion our wording caused. It was never our intention to mislead our player base about the availability of an offline mode.

The game did not feature an offline mode in the recent three rounds of playtesting either. Intentionally misleading our players while conducting playtests that clearly reveal the absence of an offline mode would be nonsensical. (We admit, however, that our description could have been more thoughtfully worded...)

For more information, please refer to the official announcement here:

SOME MINOR REFINMENT REQUIRED like in some levels climbing is impossible at the edges like in snow glaciers level and in final destination train station level its hard to climb from tracks and from water, and some areas edges the climb doesn’t work, need some polishing specially for this kind of levels where we have chance to comeback by climbing

Our intention with th sentence ""Paw it out with your friends both online and offline."" was to convey that you can play with your friends remotely (online), or together in the same location using the same device (offline) through split-screen.

We sincerely apologize for any confusion our wording caused. It was never our intention to mislead our player base about the availability of an offline mode.

The game did not feature an offline mode in the recent three rounds of playtesting either. Intentionally misleading our players while conducting playtests that clearly reveal the absence of an offline mode would be nonsensical.

but, if they put a microtransaction and a slot machine like that the game should be free in first place so everyone can play with their friends

the game are content rich but stumble with engagement
when they eventually free, it's already to late.

Take example from fortnite and apex legends devs.
if they charge me to play Apex for $20 i wouldn't play (ever) not interested in the first place.

and now, i spend $500 just for an heirloom and skins.

Different weapons (Though lots of very similar)

Said offline in description tho when people bought it thinking there would be offline there wasn't leading to lots of negative reviews and complaints due to a miscommunication.
Some people can move before the start timer finishes (I think fixed now)

Huh. 

I've waited. A good long while for this game to come out. Played the beta in 2020. Immediately fell in love with the style and a new game to the party brawlers. Waited patiently for 3 more years. Missed the first playtest. Played the next 2, and let me tell you. This game is a mixed bag. I like the game at its core, but everything else is muddied and I dont know how to feel about it. Let me explain. 
[h3] What I liked [/h3] 
[list]

[*] The gameplay. Its fun! It's a TON of fun. Its Gang Beasts meets Fall Guys. Its fun and easy to get into. Theres a lot of powerful items and moves, but the randomness in the physics and the large amount of players. Means theres still a pretty low skill ceiling and approachable to everyone.

[*] The style! Its so cute. Its a very pretty game and the fluffy animals beating the absolute piss out of each others is a fun spectacle.

[*] The maps! While I havent played much of the new maps. The maps that were in the beta. Were fun, unique, had a neat gimmick to them. Theyre well designed and fun to fight in.
[/list]
Unfortunately that's where my positives end and my gripes begin. 
[h3] What I don't Like. [/h3]
[list]
[*] No offline. Yep a game claiming that it has singleplayer and had offline local coop. It in fact. Doesnt. I would say I'm hurt by a company lying. If it werent so ****ing common nowadays. So no local coop unless you got a connection. What a joke. Gang Beasts had that sorted and that game is almost 10 years old now.

[*] Microtransactions. Now I get it. A company has to cover its costs somehow. It still feels grimy that a paid indie game has paid cosmetics and a full fledged shop. When problems exist in the game and they lie about offline coop. I know offline isnt in the game because they worry about you cheating past their store. Thankfully. Its not an entirely bad shop. Currency is earned in game for free by leveling up, and the free currency you earn can be used to unlock decent skins as well. As well as unlocking skins completing challenges. Still tho. With a game like this. Saying ""skins for animals"" just is weird to me. IMO tho. 

[*] Lootboxes.......****ing really? Pay 120 of your party animal fun bucks or whatever and get a randomized skin. Why? You already have a fortnite item shop. Did you really have to finish it off with that? We left that shit with Battlefront 2. 

[*] The gamemodes. Look. I want to beat the piss out of my fellow animal. Thats it. The other gamemodes are a complete waste on me because, like fall guys. I dont want to team up with strangers that wont do the objective. They want to beat the piss out of their fellow man too. Not play bootleg FIFA or Lucio Ball. They tend to either last 10 seconds as the team stomps the other. Or drags on all the way to the end timer and just isnt fun at all. 

[*] The quit penalty. This game isn't Valorant or CSGO. Why is there a leave penalty when people can join mid match if someone leaves? If someone (like me) doesnt want to play buzzball or soccer for the 2rd or 3th time in a row and want to play the elimination style modes instead.
[/list]
[h3] My suggestions [/h3]
[list] 
[*] Make the Team game modes separate. Fall guys did it so you can queue into those modes. So friends wanting to work with each other. Can. The gamemodes are fun, just not when playing all the time. Separate the game modes and adjust the XP gains to incentives team modes. Or if you dont want to do any of that. Just make it a best of 5. First team to 3 wins. Its that easy. Shortens the length. If you are getting stomped it ends sooner, and close match games can happen much more frequent. I would actually stick around to play them out. 

[*] Remove the quit penalty. Theres no reason for it. There is no rank system at all. We aint competing for the world cup. It'll be of no issue to get rid of it. 

[*] Work on offline ASAP. You told us it would be here on launch. It isn't. That doesn't sit well with anyone. 

[*] Make sure you maintain the currency gained so that people who do put in the time with this game dont feel cheated and the need to buy skins (tho thats exactly what you want isnt it?) I dont think the microtransactions are inherently scummy, but I still hate them in any game.
[/list]
[h3] Closing thoughts [/h3] 
Funnily enough. I enjoy the game. Its fun! Its Fall Guys meets Gang Beasts. The beat em up style gameplay is just fun and chaotic. I will be playing the shit out of this game and I would recommend off the gameplay alone, but with the current issues. I wont at the moment. If you got this far and still decide to get it. All I ask is that you dont support them in their shop. Not until the game is in a better spot and the issues everyone has are addressed.

Thanks for reading!

[h3] Update after one day [/h3]

All my points still stand. Including the leave penalty. The point I forgot to convey was that the game still punishes you. Well before the game starts. So if you see it about to get voted. You just cannot leave w/o punishing. Even tho the game hasnt started and theres still a full minute waiting period that your characters are in a locker room. That should be more than enough time to safely leave a game you dont want to play. That goes for any game mode not just the sports modes. I agree with keeping it after the game has started, but its not needed before.

After seeing this review got a lot of traction, and a lot of comments clearly missing the point that a review is completely subjective in their thoughts on it.

The microtransactions seems a little heavy handed, that said you do get all the game and quite a few characters to start so makes sense...I think my issue is with current microtransaction culture in general so not targeted to these guys in particular. And as a multiplayer focused game that requires servers, kind of makes sense. If they keep adding levels for free moving forward I think it works out overall.
I would much prefer the ability to have an offline mode so I could have just got on and played local couch co-op, but if they get on top of the queue times I think this won't matter so much. Not ideal though.

So, since this game is ripping off Gang Beasts, that is what I will be comparing it to. I am going to not focus so hard on the server issue since it just launched and mainly focus on the objective long-term facts of things that likely are not going to change.

[list]
    [*][b]Terrible optimization[/b], I get it, you look slightly better than Gang Beast but I would rather you not if it means mid-range GPU's can't achieve a solid 60fps. Even the Xbox port can only do 30.  Gang Beast could run on a potato 60fps, this a decent PC will struggle to maintain 60. Overheating issues, extremely common. MINIMUM settings should mean a playable experience. RECOMMENDED settings should mean 60fps. I swear these cash grab developers consider ""minimum"" to mean hey it launches, and recommended to mean ""well it's 30 fps on low settings good enough"". By the time you turn down all the settings to get it running at decent FPS (with lots of dips) it already looks way worse than Gang Beast so what was even the point of doing a graphics upgrade if you could not optimize it properly? NO ONE CARES ABOUT REALISTIC FUR WE WANT STABLE FPS
    [*]Ripped off gang beasts, but somehow made the [b]controls terrible[/b]. In Gang Beast you controlled each hand, you could rotate your body around, it was more versatile and felt like there was something to master. Here you just mash buttons, literally, mash buttons get lucky
    [*]A TERRIBLE completely [b]anti-consumer micro transaction model[/b]. You really need to add micro transactions FINE, add some reasonably priced skins. Loot boxes and $30 skin packs? No, just absolutely not. Once again, in Gang Beast you got everything for free after purchasing the game.
    [*]Rounds feel more like [b]complete luck than any skill[/b]. This is a common complaint. I was able to win my first round versus quite a few people by just mashing buttons. The round didn't last long and it didn't feel very exciting or interesting. The controls are so clunky and lacking any sort of mastery that it's just like ""OH who will randomly knock someone out first?!""
[/list]

Overall, all you had to do was take Gang Beast, and make it better. You failed miserably by not focusing enough on the optimization, adding greedy anti-consumer micro transactions, making the controls so dumbed down and random (mastering climbing was FUN in Gang Beasts, here you hold two buttons), and taking out the excitement of rounds in Gang Beasts were it felt like were your skill and wit could win rounds, not button mashing.

But hey, at least you ripped off one thing right, you ripped off Gang Beast's terrible servers and somehow even did it worse than them! So congratulations. Don't be surprised if this review doesn't last long, the moderators are deleting negative reviews.

This is the effort of many years of development, so many play tests and you couldn't figure this out? Really? You aren't being ""review bombed"" your game STINKS.

Refunded. Another 5 years of Gang Beasts til someone can do it right.

Some quality of life features I would love to see in future patches are OCE servers and offline mode. Just about 200 ping is playable for this type of game.

The game is actually really fun if you don't care too much about collecting all the cosmetics.

As to why this game is ""always online"" and lacks actual local co-op: your guess is as good as mine. Want to have a little fun on the go with your Deck? Nope. You need to use some kind of internet connection. I could guess and say ""They don't want people to know how the servers work behind the scenes"" but it probably has to do with cosmetics.

Also, there's one ""Global Server"" for all players. Works fine for me but, again, truly sucks if you just want to play with friends on the couch.

[h2] Cosmetics, item shop and 'lootboxes' [/h2]

If you care about cosmetics, however, you need to know how this game is monetized:
[list]
    [*] Premium currency in a paid game. Not even Fall Guys had this and I knew it was eventually going to be F2P.
    [*] The ""Surprise Eggs"" mechanic (lootboxes) give you a random skin and can give you duplicate skins. You can use 120 bucks to roll one and get a random skin or a duplicate skin, worth 450 cookies, which is unironically almost worthless.
    [*] You, however, are guaranteed to get cool cosmetics from time to time. Just don't be picky.
[/list]

If you're fine with getting random cosmetics, game on. If you'd planned to be the cool goose with the ""Deal With It"" glasses, look elsewhere, as those are locked behind Surprise Eggs.

If you only care about having fun from time to time then yeah, this game is for you. Just be aware they might as well make this game F2P at some point in >2 years from now, and they'll probably do a sale.

[strike] And, uhm, yeah, game pass. [/strike] Apparently it's not on PC Game Pass, only Xbox Game Pass. Which adds salt to injury, as some people have regular console Game Pass but not Ultimate (Xbox Live Gold + Game Pass) so they can't play it.

Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of video games, it's rare to find a title that truly stands out as a genre-defining masterpiece. Recreate Games has managed to do just that with their latest release. This game is not just amazing; it's a one-of-a-kind experience that sets a new standard for its genre.

Visuals
The first thing that strikes you about this game is its breathtaking visuals. The attention to detail, the lighting, and the textures are all top-notch. It's clear that a lot of effort has gone into making this game a visual spectacle. The graphics are not just good; they're groundbreaking, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of video game artistry.

Gameplay
As for the gameplay, it's nothing short of exhilarating. The mechanics are smooth, the controls are intuitive, and the game design is innovative. Whether you're a casual gamer or a hardcore fan of this genre, you'll find something to love in the gameplay experience. It's fun, engaging, and offers a level of depth that keeps you coming back for more.

Controversy and Criticism
Despite its brilliance, the game has faced some inexplicable hate online. It's perplexing to see such a well-crafted game receive negative attention, and it almost seems as though rivals are ganging up to tarnish its reputation. However, after spending considerable time with the game, it's hard to understand the basis for these criticisms. The game not only meets but exceeds expectations in every department.

Conclusion
Recreate Games has outdone themselves with this release. It's a game that doesn't just excel in one area; it sets a new benchmark for what games in this genre should aspire to be. If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out on one of the finest gaming experiences available today.

146649976,english,"My initial review of this wonderful game was negative because my experience was very undesirable. However, upon gaining more playtime, looking at the developer's responses to feedback, and what other people say, I can confidently change this review to a positive one.

I'm a guy who has waited a long time for a lot of games. Elden Ring, Tears of the Kingdom, Persona 3 Reload, Pikmin 4, Baldur's Gate III, The Thousand-Year Door remake and the like... but I digress. Games aside, I have waited like the rest of you for this release. Sure, this game does have it's issues. There are complaints that certain regions, such as Australia, simply don't have any servers. The community's understanding was that this game would feature both online AND offline multiplayer. However, the developer's have since retracted and edited their statement, saying they have no plans to create an offline mode. I would highly, highly suggest they reconsider. This is an amazing title with a large following who has waited for a very long time- we're here to see it grow, not just stagnate several years down the line when online play is no longer supported.

Sure, some games have a gripping story, beautiful music, and some even the potential to romance intricate characters. Yadda yadda yadda, but can you knock the absolute cr*p out of them like this..? I didn't think so.

[TL;DR] In conclusion, this game is worth your money and your time. I hope that the games offline capabilities and online server availability will continue to grow so that more people can experience it both now and long down the line.

the gameplay was fun i enjoyed, 20 map tons of animal character 
hopefully they add more animal characters and more maps to keep the game fresh.

local co-op do exist, but you need to play it online and create room online, the way you add local co-op is still kinda buggy and theres no menu or option to add local co-op.. you have to plug in your 2nd controller or 3rd controller to pop out the local co-op menu which kinda weird when you could just add a option local co-op instead you have to unplug and plug in to pop out the option for local co-op to play.. and i suggest in future you could matchmaking while in local co-op that would be amazing

server and offline mode
yeah the servers are weird idk if its only my place but it was red 345ms-609ms, but the game is playing fine tho even theres a little delay input surely they fix this in future

the ingame currency are weird i know the dev need money to keep the game alive but if the game are free i dont mind buck purchaseable thru only real money, but since the game paywall and now they want to charge more money for skin thats kinda off but at least you can make people progress into the game to get skin in achievement but would be great treats could exchange to buck

overall the game was 8/10 really hope in future they add offline mode and change the currency treats=buck",1695220285,1695263478,TRUE,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198315165833,26,4,3850,129,121,1706869919

Move over, Dark Souls, because Party Animals has taken the crown for infuriating gamers worldwide. Forget dodging fire-breathing dragons or parrying giant swords, try keeping a bunch of chaotic, physics-defying animals under control at a rager of a party. It's like herding cats, but the cats are jacked up on espresso and wielding sledgehammers.

You'll find yourself questioning your life choices as you desperately attempt to guide these party animals through levels that seem designed by a deranged cartoonist with a vendetta against your sanity. You think defeating Ornstein and Smough was hard? Try getting a gang of drunken penguins to cooperate long enough to pass a level without tumbling into an abyss.

And just when you think you've got it all figured out, some maniacal ostrich decides to clothesline you off a ledge, sending you into a fit of rage that not even Artorias at his angriest could match. Forget ""Praise the Sun""; you'll be chanting ""Curse the Fluff"" in no time.

So if you're ready to have your composure shattered faster than a controller hitting the wall, dive into Party Animals and experience a level of fury that'll make even the toughest Dark Souls boss seem like a cuddly teddy bear.

My teammate that I carried to the half-way line somehow managed to escape the brawl and score the touchdown. Absolute chaos.

[b]Original Review:[/b] The games got potential, I had well over a few hundred hours on the 2020/recent betas. It's infuriating as a supporter to just be outright forgotten about and then on top of that the community mods trying to silence and ban anyone like myself complaining going to extreme lengths to shut us up.

[b]The reality is we live in 2023. and when you bring a game out and cant even cover the 6 continents in terms of servers then don't expect a positive response. You've essentially shut out half the community that wants to support you.[/b] and the games community mods just ban anyone going against the grain.

The other reality is that this game had perfect servers in 2020 and it seemed that everyone was able to play on their own servers. But somehow within the last 3 years of work on the game. They seem to have taken EVERY server out apart from the US, EU Asia and for some reason a China server.

Without these servers to provide good ping to the surrounding players. The game becomes insanely unplayable, with the already obvious natural delay with characters in this game the ping issue makes this even worse. The experience you get playing on 150+ ping is not the same as playing on 10-100.

Ignoring these countries and continents was a huge drop of the ball and until they have finally added them I cant in good conscience say this is a great game.

146642863,english,"No offline mode.

I am seriously tired of games advertised as having singleplayer and local coop not being playable offline because they need to sell their microtransactions. I was excited for this game but now I couldn't care less.

Literally false advertising:

""Fight your friends as puppies, kittens and other fuzzy creatures in PARTY ANIMALS! Paw it out with your friends both online and **offline**. Interact with the world under our realistic physics engine. Did I mention PUPPIES?""

Edit: 

The devs responded by pointing out that the game was only playable online during closed testing. I have participated in many closed and open alpha and beta tests and can say this is standard in the industry for a game that hasn't released. Studios typically make playtest builds require internet connection so that they can control when players can access a free copy of the game, stress test servers, collect playtesting data, and avoid the game being accessible early through piracy which is completely reasonable for an unreleased game that noone has bought. With that, an online requirement for an early play test of a game in no way says that the game wouldn't be playable offline on release. As an example COD typically requires you to be online when playing the beta tests however every COD on console has offline play. I would have been shocked if any decent size game was playable offline during playtesting.

But the devs expected me to ignore the product description that specifically said the game was playable offline and judge whether or not the game was playable offline on a closed play test I had access to? You guys said the game was playable offline in the product description and have the audacity to say ""The game did not feature an offline mode in the recent three rounds of playtesting either.""

146640909,english,"A Wildly Fun Time, But Penguins Are Missing!

Party Animals is an absolute blast! From the moment I picked up my controller, I was immersed in a world of hilarious mayhem and adorable, quirky characters. The game's colorful and whimsical design instantly draws you in, making it impossible not to smile while playing.

The gameplay is simple to pick up but offers a surprising depth of strategy as you tackle various mini-games and challenges. Whether it's teaming up with friends or competing against them, every match is a chaotic carnival of laughter and excitement. The ragdoll physics and unpredictable outcomes of each round keep you on your toes, making every game an unforgettable experience.

The variety of mini-games and maps is impressive, offering hours of entertainment with friends and family. I appreciate the effort the developers put into creating diverse challenges, ensuring that no two games feel the same. The customization options for your furry (or not so furry) friends are a delightful touch, allowing you to make your character truly unique.

However, as much fun as Party Animals is, I can't help but think it's missing one crucial element: penguins! These charismatic birds would be a fantastic addition to the game, adding a whole new layer of chaos and fun to the existing animal roster. I can already imagine the laughs and antics they would bring to the party. Developers, please consider adding penguins in a future update – they would be the icing on the cake for this already incredible game.

In conclusion, Party Animals is an absolute riot of a game that will have you and your friends rolling with laughter. While it's already a fantastic experience, the addition of penguins would take it to a whole new level of hilarity. Don't miss out on this fantastic title – grab your friends and prepare for some unforgettable party moments!",1695210217,1695211157,TRUE,1,0,0.4051630496978759,2,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,76561198041538918,832,7,1435,0,13,1699484650

[b] People are impatient! [/b]

The game just released and is having server issues which the team is working on.

Everyone is Negative Reviewing because during the first few hours of it's launch they couldn't get into a game.

While the Local Coop reasoning is valid, most of the negative reviews are down right silly.

The game isn't riddled with micro-transactions at all. In fact you get coins every time you level up so you can get the paid outfits. I've already unlocked 20+ outfits and have the achievement to prove it!

After a long time, I'm genuinely having fun with a game. This is a blast, a mix of Fall Guys and Gang Beasts, while still being unique enough to have it's own identity.
