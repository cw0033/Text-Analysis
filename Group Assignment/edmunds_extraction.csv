"ghulet","September 2005"," ....I had a '77 Caprice when I was in high school and college, it had a speedometer, odometer (no trip) and a gas gauge, that was about it; there was a gauge package optional on those cars, but you don't see it too often (not that you even see the cars too often, at this point). Still, that was one of the best cars I ever owned. "
"boomchek","September 2005"," Oh you can enjoy and relive all those memories my friend once you get into this Chevy. It's a 78 Impala which is the same thing as the Caprice and the gauges are exactly as you describe them. I have 99572kms on it and since it's a 5 digit odometer it will turn over to 0 very soon. :shades:The car floats like a boat, handles like a bus, and guzzles gas like there's no tommorow. I'm thinking of selling it but I like it too much.  "
"andre1969","September 2005"," that Impala has a 2.56:1 rear end. If you go to www.tirerack.com, and look up some tires that are the same size that are on your car, in the specs they list how many revolutions per mile the tires will turn. For instance, a 205/75/R-15 tire, which was most likely standard on that car (or they might've cheaped out and put 195/75/R-15s, like Chrysler did on the '79-81 R-bodies) turns 769 rpm. Multiply that by 2.56, and that'll give you the revolutions per mile, which would also happen to be the revolutions per minute at 60 mph. In this case 1969 rpm. To get the rpm@70 mph, just take the 1969 and multiply by 7/6ths, which gives you 2297.Now I'm sure this isn't an exact calculation, but should give you a pretty close estimate. I'd imagine that the actual rpms of the engine would be a bit higher, due to slippage in the transmission and such, even though these cars probably had a lockup torque convertor by that time.Oh, and here's a little nostalgia trip for you guys... http://www.tocmp.com/brochures/Chev/1979/index.html "
"ghulet","September 2005"," ...what engine does your Chevy have (BTW, is it a Caprice or Impala)? Mine had the 305 two-barrel V8, which produced a not-so-robust 145hp, IIRC (less than many four-cylinders do now). It never felt all that underpowered, though, and gas mileage seemed OK at the time (probably about 20mpg on the highway, I imagine about 15 in the city). I suppose this car seemed frugal to me at the time mostly because the car I had before was a '71 Buick Electra, which probably used twice as much fuel.Andre, that brochure reminds me again that almost everything was optional. Didn't matter if you were buying an Impala or Caprice, pretty much the only differences were in trim. If you wanted things we take for granted now on cars (A/C, remote mirrors, rear defrost) on up to more luxurious items (power windows/locks/seat, tilt wheels), you were going to pay for them. Can't remember ever having seen a big Chevy with a power sunroof back then, didn't even know that was optional; of course, you didn't even see those much even on Cadillacs and Lincolns, sunroofs were quite exotic at the time, IIRC. "
"boomchek","September 2005"," I think it has a 305 V8. I personally don't know what the difference is between the Impala and the Caprice as they both looked identical (maybe it was a trim level?).Mine is pretty basic as it has no power windows, no power locks, no tilt, no cruise. It has an AM Radio with ""tone"" control  with a centrally mounted dash speaker (for that surround sound impression :P ).It has no tach, no coolant temp guage, no trip odometer, no factory windshield washer (it does have an aftermarket one ), no right headlight and grille at the moment. It does however have the rear window defroster, four ashtrays, a cigarette lighter, and a big ol' bench seat in the front. On another note I think I'm (gulp) grown up!!!! :surprise: I had my new Civic for a month now and even though I have an aftermarket exhaust and a nice sound system ready for it (from my previous Civic) I am in no hurry to install it. For some reason I want to leave it stock, enjoy the neweness of the car, and have a nice quiet ride. I guess I don't feel the need to impress anyone with a big coffee can exhaust and pounding bass.Maybe next year I'll rebecome immature  "
"andre1969","September 2005"," if it's an Impala or a Caprice is whether or not there's carpeting on the lower door panels. You could get cloth or vinyl in both the Impala and Caprice, but the Impala, at least the '77-85, never had carpeting on the lower door panels. As for the grille, they were very close in '78, but the Caprice had kind of an eggcrate grille, with the horizontal bars being about as thick as the vertical bars, while the Impala's grille had three prominent horizontal bars, and with much more horizontal grille openings.Impala and Caprice taillights were usually different, too. The Impala usually had the backup light in between the two outer lights. The Caprice usually had three red taillights on either side, with backup lights inboard, framing the license plate.As for whether it's a 305 or a 350, chances are it's a 305. That's how most of them were equipped. One way to tell though, would be to take the top off the air cleaner and see whether it's a 2-bbl or a 4-bbl. I think there was a 4-bbl option for the 305, but the vast majority of them were 2-bbls. The 350 was only offered as a 4-bbl by that time.The 350 is also a pretty gutsy engine, even the emasculated ones from around that time. While it only had 170 hp, I think it had around 280-290 ft-lb of torque. So if you had one, I don't think you'd be complaining about it feeling weak or anything! Well, unless you're used to driving Mustang 5.0's or something! :shades: "
"ghulet","September 2005"," ...the Mustang 5.0s of the time only had about 150hp, IIRC, so the 350 would only compare unfavorably to a newer version. Actually, I got the Caprice rather than the orange '79 Mercury Capri 5.0 someone was selling right around the corner from my HS. I really liked that car, but it was more money than mom wanted to spend (actually, my uncle talked her out of it, I think he was jealous), so I got the Caprice instead, which was probably a good thing in the end (I got in enough trouble as a teenager with a car, absent parents and a fairly serious substance abuse problem as it was, don't think an orange V8 pony car would have helped any!).

"stickguy","September 2005"," probably about right for a dealer service. And while it probably includes some items that aren't required in the manual, I would do all of them except maybe the PS service, just as preventive maintenance. Assuming of course you plan to keep the car for a while.You could save some money by having it done by a local mechanic if you have one, but probably not that much, since there is a fair amount of labor involved. Or, do some of the easy stuff yourself and save some $$ (stuff like the air filter). You can also save by having the rotation and various inspections done at a reputable tire/brake shop.pretty much it becomes a function of how comfortable you are with non-dealer service centers, and how much time/energy you want to invest in the process.But, a Focus isn't exactly a Maybach, so you should be able to get this basic service done just about anywhere. The only piece that I worry about is the tranny service, since you want to make sure they use the correct fluid. That one I always like a dealer to do, but that's just me.Hey, you asked for my opinion! "
"andre1969","September 2005"," the power steering service is most likely Bull. FWIW, I've NEVER had a power steering service done on my '00 Intrepid, and it's got 110,000 miles on it now. Although now that I said that, watch it fail on me! I've never had a fuel filter replaced, either. Usually they're in the tank nowadays, and they're supposed to be good for the life of the car...which means that when they DO fail, you're talking some big bucks!I also doubt there's anything in the steering and suspension that can be lubed anymore...isn't most of that stuff usually sealed away these days? I thought grease fittings were a thing of the past? You might want to get the tranny service done, depending on how you drive. I've had my Intrepid's tranny done every 30,000 miles, just to be safe. The last time I had it done was at a local tranny shop, and they charged around $78.$388 sounds like an awful lot to me for just poking around a car, rotating the tires, changing a few filters, and flushing the power steering and tranny. But, the times they are a'changin'! "
"stickguy","September 2005"," isn't this FOcus a stick? If so, discount the price of the tranny service, since that assumes it is an AT. At most, they would drain/refill the transaxle fluid, which probably isn't needed at this point anyway, but a local guy could easily do it. "
"andre1969","September 2005"," the Dodge dealer tried to get me to come in for a 30,000 mile service on my Intrepid. They wanted to hit me up with a bunch of stuff like belts (60K interval, according to the owner's manual) and hoses (5yr/100K), coolant flush 5yr/100k), a tuneup (50k severe service/100K ""regular"" service), and other assorted bull, for around $300. The main thing I was concerned about was the transmission, which this service didn't even cover! I think they wanted to hit me with another $150 or so for that! "
"rowlandj","September 2005"," Find out what the warranty requires and find a local shop to do whatever the owners manual suggests for each service interval.All that 'inspect this and that' is pretty much nonsense at the mileage you have. I am sure that the actual MANUFACTURER recommended items have much longer intervals and I think the dealers load up their services way over what is needed.Finally, I think you will find that there would be a recommendation in the owners manual against any kind of oil or fuel additives so that last line makes me call the entire thing into question even if the rest were valid items.JR "
"bobst","September 2005"," The moral of the story: Find a service provider you can trust.From my unfortunate experience with a Ford, I think yours at 30K miles is about on its last legs. If you find someone you trust to service the car, it may last for a few more days. "

"michaellno","September 2005"," I called the dealer where I purchased the Focus, and they quoted me $425 for the 30K service!I asked about the transmission, since it is a stick, and they told me they drop the pan, check the gaskets and filters, and replace the fluid.Next step will be to check the owners manual to see what the manufacturer says ought to be done.bobst: ouch! I'm kinda hoping that it'll last longer than the 31K I currently have on it .. though I know you have an affinity for Honda products, I'm reasonably confident that the stuff made in the US (well, Mexico in the case of the Focus) is pretty well screwed together.

"anonymousposts","September 2005"," How's the LS working out? Do you regret trading the 350 yet? "
"michaellno","September 2005"," Thanks for the feedback ... the only issues that the car is having at the moment is some squeaking brakes (been that way since I bought the car), but now I'm getting a bit of ""shudder"" through the steering wheel, which may mean that I need to have them looked at a bit closer, plus the power steering ""groans"" when making a left turn.I've never been much of a shade tree mechanic - I once drained the crankcase of my folks '73 Corona and put 5 quarts of oil in the transmission, then attempted to drive 35 miles to a basketball game when I was in high school - so I've never had a problem taking my cars into the dealer for service.But, as many of you rightfully point out, $400 for what amounts to a glorified LOF with a bunch of inspections seems a bit steep.I'm curious as to what the local ""drive thru"" oil change place would charge .. perhaps a phone call to them might be in order.BTW, this would be the last visit to the dealer while the car is still under the 3/36 warranty, so there might be an advantage to having them give the car a once over and get any warranty items taken care of. "
"stickguy","September 2005"," good point. If the PS is groaning, have them look at that at least. "
"andre1969","September 2005"," the shudder occur? If it does it while you're braking, then your rotors could be warped. Otherwise, you might just need your tires balanced. Often when your tires go out of balance, there's a certain speed that the car will shudder. For instance, my '89 Gran Fury used to be fine up to around 60 mph, but would then shudder, until you got it up over 70 or so.One other possibility is a bent rim, which might also make the steering shudder at certain speeds.Also, you might want to watch some of those quickie lube places...they're often more gouge-happy than the dealer! I guess I'm also a bit leery, because I've had bad experiences with some of them. Years ago, my uncle took our '85 Silverado to a quickie place to have the oil changed. This was back in the early 90's, when it hardly got driven. I was still in college, and maybe once or twice a week I'd drive it to school just so it wouldn't sit. Well, one morning, a few days after the oil had been changed, I hopped in the truck and turned the key. Oil light came on like it normally does...but never went off! I shut it off immediately, popped the hood, and checked the dipstick. Dry. Looked underneath to find a loose drainplug, and a nice slick on the grass where the truck was parked.Oh, and a few years ago, I had a bit of a run-in with Firestone. The exact quote I got from the managerette on duty was ""LOOK, we don't have time to look up the oil requirements of every single car out there. 10W-30 works fine with most of them!"" Ummm, seems to me that if you're a professional, then knowing, or looking up if you DON'T know, the oil requirements of a customer's car just goes with the territory! Oh yeah, the only times I've had power steering groan was when it was running low on fluid. It was saying ""FEED ME""!  "
"asafonov","September 2005"," I would stay away from massively franchised LOF shops (everybody knows their names) that advertise 12.99 or 15.99 oil changes. Use word of mouth, or Cartalk's Mechani-X files search to locate a reputable mechanic in your area.

But for now, I'm probably maintaining status quo, but I am definitely officially in the market.The 2006 Accord was a nice piece, but they are up to $24,700 MSRP for an EX-L 4 cyl 5 speed stick. Lotta coin for the configuration.I'm real interested in seeing the Fusion when it comes out to compare it to the Honda's. Doesn't hurt that my neighbor is the GSM at a Ford dealer either. "

"corvette","September 2005"," The exception I have seen is that Big O Tires tends to have good, honest service (and, they're cheap, at least for the things I used them for). The ones I've been to don't do transmission fluid or coolant, but they can handle the LOF stuff, tires, brakes, shocks, and alignment, which is nearly all you need. Most of us will never own a car long enough to reap the benefit of maintaining it according to a dealer's excessive schedule. Even if we did, it might not pay off. I see way too many people ignore or creatively interpret service requirements on Camries, 626's and the like, and these people still have reliable cars. I think a lot of it is just dumb luck. "
"anonymousposts","September 2005"," What did you not like about the Civic? Hopefully Gee and I can get out soon to take a look at them. We plan to tomorrow when we go on our quarterly toy shopping trip for little Gee.The new Accord may MSRP for $24,700 but I have a feeling you could probably get one for around $22,000. A leftover 05 would be even less. You'd be missing out on the refresh and heated mirrors but otherwise it has all of the safety equipment you need (good selling point to Mrs. Stickguy), good performance, and great gas mileage consider the size of the car.The Fusion is interesting. However, I'm not to fond of the interior. Overall, it's OK but that steering wheel is not to my liking. It also looks a bit dated to me, at least in the photos I've seen recently. Additionally, it uses the same 2.3L as the Mazda6 if I am not mistaken but is bigger and heavier. That doesn't sound good for performance. The 6 is a bit of a dog at low RPM as it is. And they muted the sound of the engine. One thing I enjoyed about the 6 with the 5-speed and the 2.3 was the sound and feel of the car at high RPM. "

I really am concerned with the seats, since they are tres important to me (I just like good seats, and have some back issues). The Accord does feel good though.The supply of '05s (especially sticks, limited to start with) is starting to dry up. My dealer had a ton of '06s already hidden in back.

I even really like it in your color (Redrock).However, not likely that they are dropping 2.5K off MSRP on an '06 anytime soon. Maybe a clearance deal on an '05 for close to 20?I really do want to like the CIvic more, since it is over 4K cheaper MSRP (18.8 vs. 23K, comparing EX to EX) "
"anonymousposts","September 2005"," in our Accord is one of the reasons I love it. Even when I was 9 months pregnant I was comfortable. No back or butt pain on long trips either. Before I make a final judgement I will have to see and drive the Civic in person. I'm also guessing that you might have liked the EX more because it has an armrest and the roof. It's usually not a good idea to test drive a car that's not identical to the one you want. After seeing the 06 Accord in person I think I like my 04 better. IMHO, the 04 Accord looks like it was designed with the whole car in mind. With the 06 I got the impression they just fixed what people said was wrong with it. I like the new rear by itself but think the 03-05 rear suits the rest of the car better. I know I am in the minority though.Doesn't seem like you drive much so why not go all out and lease yourself a 06 6-speed sedan? You'd give up a couple of MPG but gain a whole lot in the way of power and driving fun. Take the money from your tC and let it draw interest. "

If the new car comes with payments, I will get the evil eye from Mrs. stick, but I can live with that.Also, the Civic LX has a fantastic armrest, seems quite similar to the Accord I also sat in. I require a roof, but the EX civic was otherwise pretty identical to the LX. I did test fit, and had plenty of headroom (moe than I got now!).I plan to go shopping early tomorrow.

"stickguy","September 2005"," OT (assuming we have one here) but something this dealer group now has that facilitates impulse shopping is cool. Instead of waiting while the sales dude writes down stock numbers and wanders away to look for keys, they have boxes on each car (similar to the electronic key boxes realtors now use). He puts in the code, and gets the keys to any car. Pretty handy since most of th stock is now kept in a somewhat remote cnetral lot (it's a mutli store dealer row operation). "

The Civics felt a bit better than the ones in the car I drove last night (but I really do neet to try a car without plastic wrap on the seat), but not quite Accord level. I actually think I would be happy with either one, even though they do have soemwhat different personalities.To me, the Accord doesn't really offer enough extra value to justify the difference in price (18.8k for the Civic, 23K for the Accord), with is just over 4 grand. Of course, real world pricing may be closer, but I do think the Accord is a little overpriced, or maybe I'm just out of touch. "

"michaellno","September 2005"," Before I met my wife, I think she owned 3 cars in 15 years:VW BeetleDatsun 210Ford TempoIn the 9 years we've been together, she's had the following as her daily drivers for a length of time:Ford Escort LXVW New BeetleFord ExplorerSaturn L300Saturn VUEPlus, we've bought or leased the following that she hasn't driven regularly:Ford ExpeditionChevrolet TrackerFord FocusSaturn L200Strangely, like Jolie, I'm debating with myself whether to get another car or not. The L300 has, I think, 43K and is the daughters car. The Focus has 31K on it and gets a steady 30-32MPG on my commute to and from work. The VUE has 12K on it (in 10 months!) and is the wife's daily driver - well, when its her turn to drive with her co-worker.My office will be moving at the end of next week and I'd really like to start driving the L300 again, but I like the fuel usage of the Focus. That, and has been previously mentioned and debated, the daughter hasn't learned to drive a stick.As much as I'd like to trade the Focus in for something else for the daughter to drive, I kinda like the idea of her in a larger car, just in case. Plus, it keeps the mileage down - I'm figuring that when the loan is paid off in a couple of years, the L300 will have maybe 70K on it - lots of life left with no car payments.There really isn't anything wrong with the Focus that makes me want to trade it in - it gets good mileage, has been trouble free, has all the amenities one could want (power windows, locks, cruise, tilt, keyless remote, AC, CD player). About the only thing I could see replacing it with is a Pontiac Vibe, which is very similar in many respects but gets a little bit better mileage (36 hwy vs. 32 for the Focus, according to the EPA).OTOH, all three of us really like the Saturn Sky, so when it is released early next year, I could see all logic going out the window.BTW, does anyone know what the MPG figures are for the Solstice?

However, if you consider that you will probably be able to get $1000 off of the Civic that puts it at $17,800. The Accord EX 5-speed invoices at $20,000. You should be able to get the Accord for invoice .. maybe even less. So the difference is $2200. The Accord is in it's 3rd/4th year so most of the kinks have been worked out vs. the Civic being a first year model. The Accord also has a front/rear double wishbone suspension. On the other side, the Civic gets better gas mileage, is smaller so it should be sportier and easier to manevuer, and it's cheaper. It has the same safety equipment as the Accord and pretty much the same luxury options as well. Guess you have a tough decision to make. FWIW, I love my Accord. No problems in 24,000 miles. Drives great and gives me 31 MPG in mixed driving.  Have you looked at the Mazda3/Mazda6 yet? "

The Miata may not be a great highway cruiser, but at least it has an actual trunk! "
"stickguy","September 2005"," Accord vs. Civic will be a tough choice in many cases. Are you sure that invoice is 20K? Maybe that was for the '05. MSRP of an '06 cloth EX is $23,00 even. I did like the Civic, but didn't fall in love, and the Accord does have nice seats.I did look at Mazdas yesterday. I just don't find the seats in the 6 comfy, but do really like the 3. That car just feels right to me when I sit in it, and the leather seats are nice. I plan to go drive a 3 at lunch today just for the heck of it.The Civic is rated a little higher mpg (not too much if you get the 3i model), and might be a little more refied, but I think the 3 might be more comfortable. I should have taken one out yesterday when I stopped to test sit (and get my blockbuster certificate singed).I may decide to hold out for something more luxurious, but that is more $$, so the tC may be around for a while. That is unless the Mazda dealer has something I like, and is willing to make me an offer I can't refuse.I might swing by the Volvo dealer too, just for the heck of it, in case they have a program car for cheap.At least the '06 3s are out, so there is a supply to look at.

"andre1969","September 2005"," is the new Civic really that much bigger than the old one? I never could get comfortable in the previous Civic, but the current Accord fits me just fine. "
"stickguy","September 2005"," I never really spent any time in the last gen Civic, but this one seems to have plenty of room. Up front, it's a little narrower, but other than that, seems comparable to the Accord. "

"stickguy","September 2005"," spent some time at the mazda dealer today. Turns out I like the 3 even more than I remembered. It fits me real well. I drove a Grand touring model (new this year, basically the old SP23 with every goodie on it). FOund the seats to be very comfortable, really no issues or need to rationalize (except it wouldn't mind if they tilted up slightly in the front, but I could probably fix that).Drives like a little hot rod, handles nice, pulls strong. Probably a little noiser than the Civic, but it's a ""good"" noise. Definitely the performance car in the class.SHifts nice too, but a much different layout of the shifter (you reach dwon for the stubby lever, as opposed to to reaching up in the Honda).The Honda gets better mileage, the Mazda has more torque, and still gets relatively good mileage. A 3i is almost as good as the Civic, but doesn't come with leather.The 3 can be a bit pricing. The GT was $21,060, but that includes heated leather, auto climate control, Xenons, and some other stuff the Civic doesn't have. A cloth touring without the fancy stuff like HIDs and ACC is about $19,050, so comparable to a Civic EX. Unfortunately, the 3 has no rebates or fire sale prices, but I guess you get what you pay for.I may go back tomorrow and talk some numbers on a touring w/leather (saving $1,400 worth of HIDs and auto CC that I don't really care about).

"stickguy","September 2005"," Stopped at the HOnda dealer with the family last night for a test sit (always a dangerous move). ANyway, my daughter liked the civic (because it was red, and she could keep tabs on how fast I am going with the digital speedo). My son liked the Accord, because he said the back seat was more comfy.My wife seemed OK with the Civic, but liked the Accord better. She also makes a valid point that it would be better to have the bigger car with bigger trunk, since we would plan to take it on some trips when we don't need the cargo room of the Odyssey.I also still haven't gotten myself comfortable in the drivers seat of the Civic. Spent 15 minutes in one on the showroom floor earlier in the day.Saw a 3 earlier today (in a parking lot). Wife thought it looked small.So, I think that I need to look more at ""mid size"" wheels. The current front runner is an EX-L 5 speed 4 cyl Accord, if a real good deal can be found. But, I sitll want to see the Fusion too.I may also wait for the new IS250, but that's in a whole nother price range, and won't be helping MPG either. "
"stickguy","September 2005"," the leater seats are quite comfortable. I still, however, have a problem with almost all cars without power seats. They seem to all be going to the 1-lever height adjustment, which tends to pitch you forward as it raises. I really prefer to have the front cushion tilted up (for thigh support), which pretty much requires a power seat. "
"anonymousposts","September 2005"," Got the Si washed. It's amazing how a simple car wash can make a car drive different. The Accord had developed a slight vibration/pull in the tires so we got the alignment checked. That checked out fine so we got the tires rotated and balanced. Problem solved. We had a wash done on the Accord as well. Looks like a new car again. I cane to the conclusion that Gee should not trade his Si any time soon. It's a great car and can't be beat for the price IMO. I'm also very attached to my Accord. It's really 95% of what I want in a car. It's safe, reliable, great gas mileage, XM radio, comfy seats, and good power. stickguy: There are a few people in the Civic room saying that the tC is a better car than the Civic. What's your opinion? "
"stickguy","September 2005"," hard to tell, partly because I haven't seen a coupe yet, just a 4 door. But, I would say that the Civic is every bit as good, and has better overall ride/handling. The tC does offer a lot of features for the money.I'm assuming that newer tCs have resolved the squeak and creak problems of the early one.Anyway, probably hard to go wrong with either one, and the differences will amount to personal taste.Oh, and the Civic will likely get way better mileage. "
"andre1969","September 2005"," still have better performance than the Civic, though? My impression of the tC was that it was kind of a mild musclecar, having a lightweight body with a larger Camry 4-cylinder thrown in. The previous Civic was a dog, unless you got that SI hatchback with the stronger engine. The new one, with 140 hp standard, should be much better, but I'd imagine a tC would still whoop its butt! "
"anonymousposts","September 2005"," the tC is a bit tubby for it's size. The MPG (22/29) is not that great for a small 4 cylinder car. It has a lot of content though .. which probably accounts for it's heft. I've seen 0-60 times in the high 7's-low 8's if I'm not mistaken. We stopped by a Honda dealer on the way home from toy shopping today to check out the 06 Civic but they didn't have any. Gee saw an EX sedan there last week but it was nowhere to be found today. "
"stickguy","September 2005"," is a bit porky for ist size. Plus, it is geared really short, which helps account fo rthe mileage estimates.But, to be fair, I average between 24 and 25 on most tanks, and that is real short hop around town for the most part. No real highway driving (maybe 3 miles at a time at cruising speeed). Mostly local stuff.I would guess that switching to a 2006 Civic might get my normal driving up to maybe 30, but for ~100 miles per week, not a big savings. "
"racer63","September 2005"," Remember me? Last heard from heading off for a new job with car allowance? All which is going sort of OK, with less mileage accrued in the past 9 months on the daily driver than I was doing previously.To keep this on topic, the household CEO/CFO is loosening the leash for me to consider buying something in the next 3-6 months. So many choices though. The basic criteria is 4 doors, maybe a wagon body, manual tranny, and have some kind of fun or bling factor. The list goes from PT Cruiser/HHR, through various Accords, TSX or TL's, and though it probalby will violate the stick requirement, CPO 3 series or C-class wagons.I was considering buying something totally impratical and sporty, and to continue daily driving my almost 100k Celica, but a new work car is a more rational solution. Sat in an HHR this week, and just couldn't get comfortable. The pedal/seat/steering wheel realationship was just all wrong. I'd probably get tired of the styling too after a while. I suppose the PT would be the same in that regard. But either is cheap. Accords are what they are, common middle ground plain vanilla. Either Acura would do the trick, but will both be some coin. Which leaves either of the German family trucksters, neither which I'd care to own without warranty, but both have been out for a while with '04 versions not necessarily having the teething troubles earlier years that those model runs have had. The local Benz dealer has a few Starmarked C240W's advertised for 26,999. I have a feeling the transaction price would be lower.....I'll post as the search goes on. :P "
"michaellno","September 2005"," But have moved from the reasearch to the shopping stage.Still thinking about trading in the Focus for a similar car with an automatic for the daughter. Stopped at the local Chevy and Ford dealer at lunch today to check out what they had. Saw an HHR for the first time --- not nearly as tall in person as it looked in the photos. Pretty well loaded for $16K - ABS, power everything, iPod jack in the stereo. Add another $1K for the slushbox and it's still a pretty good deal. The interior really impressed me - yes, there are still lots of plastics used, but the overall look and feel seemed to be above average.No automatic Cobalt sedans available - the green pea salesman I had located one with a $17K MSRP. Since it was an '05 it would still qualify for the employee discount through next week. Not a huge issue as I get the supplier discount from GM, Ford and DCX.Ford dealer next door only had 3 Foci that I saw - 1 ZX5 (w/ stick) and 2 ZX4s. One was an S trim, the other an SE. The SE had an auto but didn't have the cruise/tilt option, which is necessary for my daughter as she is pretty tall.Have been checking out gmbuypower and similar sites for Ford and DCX to check local inventory.The search continues....

"michaellno","September 2005"," First stop was the Saturn dealer to drive an '06 ION. Nice car, pretty well loaded for $16K (power everything, automatic, ABS/TC) except then the dealer added another $1K worth of ""accessories"" - pinstriping, mud guards, clear bra, etc. Drove quite nicely and the upgraded interior is eons better than what they offered in the past. I'm interested, as I can get the GM Supplier discount - now only if I could find one that hasn't had all the stuff added onto it.Second stop was the Kia dealer to take a look at the Spectra. They had a couple of '05 EX trim levels on the lot - it, too, was loaded but no ABS available (even as an option!). Sticker said $15.9K. For what you're paying, not a bad little car. The only thing I had against the Kia was that the seat didn't seem to go far enough back and the bottom cushion was a bit short for me. Sales manager offered to let it go for $12,500 (rebates and discounts) before I could say ""hello"". Passed as the car would be for daughter, so she needs to evaluate it as well.Don't know where either dealer would hit me on the trade in value of the Focus - I'm guessing between 7 and 8K - I owe just over $9K on it at the moment.EDIT: also drove the newly introduced Kia Rio with an automatic. If you are desparate for a new car, you might consider one of these. Lots of goodies on the inside (including 6 airbags), but the powertrain hunts often to keep the momentum going.

Eventually he liked it so much, he took an automotive sales course and now he's selling cars too After you're in the business you do look at cars slightly differently though. When I started 2 years ago, I was getting excited over every car on the lot (new and used) and had to try and drive every one of them.

"lancerfixer","September 2005"," WIth Mrs. Lance's Accord showing a progressively high component failure rate as time progresses (it IS 12 years old with an estimated ~200,000 on the broken odometer; this past week's adventure was a power window motor failure...stuck down, of course) I found myself at the local Honda joint looking at the '06 Civic.Wow, what a quantum leap over the old Civic. I drove one of two they had at the dealer (they'd had five on the front line at one point; they were down to one outside and one in the showroom, both LX autos.) First off, the dashboard/instrument cluster wasn't nearly as distracting as I thought it would be. Every other car I've driven with a digital speedometer annoyed me as the motion of the changing digits would catch the corner of my eye and would cause distraction. Somehow this doesn't happen with the Civic.I was kind of surprised (and a little disappointed) the automatic was rated 2 highway MPG higher than the manual; it's kinda tough because this would be a purely highway commuting car (Mrs. Lance racks up close to 400 mi/week) so when it comes down to it, we'll both have to make the mileage vs. fun value judgement.Interior room feels about the same as our '94 Accord, though of course with all the modern safety goodies (kudos to Honda for making ABS, side/head bags, etc standard instead of some asinine option package or an EX only thing, like other competitors in the segment.) As I mentioned, I came away really liking the dashboard. There were a couple of areas that the interior plastics seemed just a tad on the cheapish side, like on the door panels. If that's the compromise to get all the other features of the Civic at a manageable price point, though, I'd be able to live with that. The automatic did a really good job, as slushboxes go; much smoother than Honda autos of the past (which frankly wouldn't have been hard to do anyway.) Handling is, of course, Honda-precise. I'd still want to drive the stick.We'd both really like the Accord to at least last through the winter; we'll be in a much better financial position in the spring to be able to afford a payment. When the time comes, though...the '06 Civic just got bumped to the top of the list of potential replacements (and I said I'd never buy a new car...) "
"stickguy","September 2005"," go with the stick since you want it 9when it doubt, take fun). Anyway, when did everyone start taking the EPA figures as gospel (just go check out the Odyssey MPG board!).I think (occasionally) that the stick will still return as good or better mileage overall as the AT. Maybe if you truly do all highway cruising there might be a difference, but still 38 isn't going to break you. "
"lancerfixer","September 2005"," Yeah. Plus, of course, the stick is cheaper to buy in the first place.On the other hand, traffic on Mrs. Lance's commute (I-380, Cedar Rapids to Iowa City) has picked up substantially in the past few years as both cities grow quickly. A few months ago, she took my car (the slushbox Volvo) to work and remarked when she got home that she was glad to have it that day since traffic was unusually heavy (stop and go...on the interstate! In Iowa! Thought we'd left MA/NH to get away from all that...) It might just be a matter of time before she breaks down and wants an auto, anyway...  "

Also, my 2000 528i Wagon (Touring) has only 24K miles on it, so I don't have much excuse to sell it. It gets about 17mgp city & low-mid 20's highway, so rationally, not putting on a lot of miles, it wouldn't be worth it to trade for a Prius. Altho it's already $50-$60 to totally fill up the 528i; will be a real drag if gas goes higher.I supppose I could order a Prius, drive it when it comes in, & decide. And even keep the bmw for awhile so I don't have seller's remorse while I get used to the Prius. And if I wind up hating & selling the prius; I think they have great resale. Unfortunately, I couldn't really afford to keep both.One more wrinkle: I really like having cargo capacity, with a hatch (another reason for the Prius as opposed to a Civic, say).

The Saturn (risk of being a Saturn basher) is a good 12k car or there abouts -- same as the Focus and Kia.The Civic is bigger and an excellant option though. If you want inexpensive the Sentra is a decent deal although dated. And if you don't want options (or do want to spend a lot) the Toyota is an excellant car. "

"woodyww","September 2005"," Yeah........the prius is probably just a Pipe Dream. I have previously vowed to keep the E-39 until it's 9 or 10 years old. And last I looked, it might bring about $18K.

But one of the things that strikes me is, this 6 y.o. bmw has had virtually Japanese-car reliability (not to brag, I don't want to jinx it). It was made in Dingolfing (sp?), & is built like a Tank. And actually, my previous bmw, an E-24 6 Series, didn't have much of anything go wrong until about 8-9 years old, & even then it was fairly routine stuff, altho definitely more expensive & complicated than a Toyota.Uh, sorry for all the bmw talk, if it bores anyone.

I haven't even tried the DVD player yet.Why did we trade? I have no idea now. Sounded like a plan when I did it. We did lower our payments and now she has a vehicle with no miles as opposed to 49K.

"michaellno","September 2005"," congrats on the new cars, but i gotta ask -- you lowered the payments, but do you have more payments to make?I know, it's anti-CCBA to even mention fiscal responsibility, but that is one of the main reasons why I haven't pulled the trigger on a deal and trade in the Focus. I only have 30 payments left - but, if I trade it in for something new, the payments will be about the same, but i'm looking at 48 or 60 months.If I could convince the Mrs. to find a late model used car for the kid and stick with a 3 year note, I could probably get into something around $9 or $10K pretty easily. The downside is finding a car that has the equipment on it we want (automatic, ABS and keyless remote, specifically) in that price range.Hope you enjoy the Pacifica and the LS! "
"corvette","September 2005"," The base Mini Cooper should run happily on mid-grade, and electronic stability control is also an option if you're looking for safety features (if I could only choose one, I would take ESC over side airbags, you're much more likely to use the ESC).

"danf1","September 2005"," So how do you feel about Honda? "
"qbrozen","September 2005"," yes, i still have the alfa. and i still have the volvo. Trading the Z for the LS got us the cash we were looking for. Trading the Pilot for the Pacifica just got us a bit more monthly cash to apply to child care.Yes, its definitely more payments (we basically just hit that reset switch on the payment cycle). But, its highly unlikely we would have kept the Pilot past the period we would have been making payments. It already had near 50K miles in just 2.5 years. The wife is driving less now, so the Pacifica shouldn't rack them up as fast.And, yes, that is anti-CCB'er of you to ask. I think you should have to sit in the penalty box until you've learned your lesson.So, let's see, on top of the 2 cars within a couple of weeks, there was the Z purchase 6 months ago, and the old Benz purchase 6 months before that. So that's 4 within a year. The Benz and Z are both gone. Obviously, based on these habits, I don't think my volvo has anything to worry about in terms of most miles I've put on one car. 82K and counting since I purchased it 4 years ago. "
"michaellno","September 2005"," (2 minutes for cross payment checking) - sorry, I couldn't resist the hockey comment.Yeah, I'm about ready to turn in my CCBA membership card. I've got a perfect opportunity to trade in one of my vehicles and get something new, and I'm not able to pull the trigger!Sheesh.woody - don't know how much of this thread you've been through, but the Focus would be traded in for something with an automatic for my 17 year old daughter to drive. Currently, she's driving my '03 Saturn L300 (leather, V6, sunroof) while I'm driving the Focus.She wants a Mini Cooper; dad thinks that she's asking a lot. Her second choice is a Scion xA; OK, that's a bit better (read: cheaper) but, as stated above, I'm not sure that I want to start over with a new set of car payments.On top of which, she's a senior in HS and is looking to head off to college next year in a town where on-campus parking is at a premium and jobs for college age kids are tough to come by (she would need the job to pay for gas and insurance for whatever ride she has). There is one possible scenario where she doesn't have a car at all - either we sell it outright or we take it off active insurance except for when she's home in the summer. So, now it's looking as if we'll wait until next year to see where we stand, both college and job wise, before making any sort of decision.I'm thinking of putting 16"" wheels and tires onto the Focus -- gotta be a lot cheaper than a whole new car - if I'm going to continue driving it.

"racer63","September 2005"," I had about an hour and a half to kill with the family over the weekend, and thought it was time to introduce them to what I'm considering for my next ride.First stop was at the Acura dealer for TL's and TSX's, and all the response I got from Mrs. Racer was a frowny face  over $33k on the sticker. My 8 and 9 year olds, who only think Acuras and BMWs are real cars, weren't even with me, since my son wants a RSX Type S and nothing else.Next was Honda, and thay had an '06 5 speed Accord EX 4 door right out front. $23k, so the price was in the right direction for the Mrs., who clearly is her father's daughter, the man who still drives a 1990 Tempo. Her words, delivered in monotone, was: What's not to like. Kids thought it was boring.Since I knew we still hadn't reached her price point nirvana yet, and it was in the direction we had to go, the Chevy dealer was last, to show her the HHR. Which upon sight all she could do was laugh. We all piled in the one in the showroom, and after about 20 seconds, the kids were mortified to be seen in it, and my wife still hadn't stopped cackling. She thought it was the perfect old mans car. This particular one was a 5-speed, and while with more fiddling I was able to get an acceptable driving position, it did require a double jointed right elbow to operate the shifter with the right armrest down on the seat. And they wonder why nobody buys manual trannys anymore.All said and done, nobody liked anything. To be continued with another installment after our next go-around. "

"anonymousposts","September 2005"," We have been good for over a year now. Last CCB decision was trading the 04 EX-L automatic Accord for the EX-L 5-speed. That said, there was a pristine G35 Coupe 6-speed in our showroom. Only 17,000 miles. Silver/light gray leather. I almost did what any good wife would do and buy the car for Gee. He could have driven it for a few days and then decided whether he wanted to sell the Si/LS and keep the G35. I could have gotten it for $27,000. Not bad. But it had the wrong interior color and it would be better for us to wait until the mini-van goes back before buying another car. Besides, now Gee wants a Freestyle. We need to go test drive one. If we could get it for $22,000-$25,000 with the options we want then it could be a contender. Anything over $25,000 and I would rather have an Odyssey/used MDX. "

The drivers seat felt like it was designed for me, and even adjusted the way I liked (you could tilt the front cushion edge way up, and the cushion itself was nice and long for thigh support.Also lots of room inside, and a large trunk.Sticker prety well loaded up was only 21K, before the assorted expected discounts.It has what I want, so I plan to persue this one. It helps that my neighbor is the GSM at the Ford dealer close to my office!My wife decided to pull a snob act (eew, it's a Ford), but she knows diddle about cars.

That swoopy styling does take a toll on rear space. "

But, with the volumes they want to sell, and the fact that it is a domestic (feeling the qftershocks of employee pricing), they should be dealing sooner rather than later.I hope to get an invoice deal from my contact, plus there is at least $500 FMC cash out the gate, and I heard something about a DP match of another $500, but not sure if that is true.Sticker on an SE the way I want it is ~21k, invoice ~ 19.5K, less the cash incentives and we are at ~18.5-19K, which I would pay for that package.Of course, who knows what pricing will be in the middle of the winter if they are piling up on the lots.besides, I am just happy that they are making stick shift models from the beginning!

"ghulet","October 2005"," OK, so I spent the day car shopping with my friend yesterday, looking to buy either a Civic or RSX. Here's a brief-as-possible breakdown.First stop, impromptu visit to Mitsu dealer (in Matteson, IL auto mall with ~20 makes) to test drive an Eclipse (she thought it was 'cute'). She actually liked it (we tested a 4-cyl GS with sunroof and upgraded Fosgate stereo), so did I but I knew it never really was in the running, she's a Honda loyalist. Good stereo, but some strange ergonomics (climate and stereo readouts in the center of upper dash), one of the raspier-sounding fours I've heard in a while, and the body was a bit bulbous compared to a Civic or RSX. Also, it has a four-speed auto where the other two have five. That said, the sticker was a reasonable ~$22k, and I think we could have knocked a bit off that, given how Mitsus are selling now.Second stop, closest Honda dealer, at the same auto mall. They had exactly ONE '06 Civic (a black with tan cloth LX coupe) in stock, already sold, so we couldn't even test drive. Our salesguy was a green pea (first week), nice guy, then we got a 'closer' who really tried to get us to put down a deposit ('but it's refundable', he says--on a car we hadn't even driven); we said no, at which point he basically implied that we were out of luck. We had already given the salesguy her info and what we'd like, so after that we were on our way.Third, another Honda dealer. They had four '06 Civics (including a beautiful Atomic Blue EX sedan I loved), we test drove an EX coupe automatic; nice car, and I even fit OK in the back seat with the sunroof (I'm 6'0""). She seemed to like it quite a bit, but the coupe we drove was white/tan (I advised to never buy any car with light tan cloth), so they would have to locate what she wanted. I should note that neither dealer had a manual Civic, and I didn't see any manual Accords, though I didn't look thoroughly and both dealers had tons of them. Just an aside, am I the only one who thinks almost $20k ($19610 MSRP for an EX automatic, and nobody's discounting a cent) for a 140hp Civic is a bit crazy?On to the Acura dealer, just down the street. We test drove a base, leather, automatic RSX in white, not her color choice. After I compared stats between it and the Integra, I figured (since I wasn't aware yet, the salesguy confirmed) that they were built off the same platform. Bottom line, she drove it (said it felt 'natural', can't imagine why!), loved it and put down a deposit on one in Jade Green metallic; salesguy claims they sell a lot in that color. Funny, I've never seen one, and the closest I could find on AutoTrader was in Kansas City (~400 miles away). I'm happy for her, though I probably would have chosen the Civic (though I'm a sedan guy, hands down), just for the $3k savings (she's also paying MSRP on the RSX), the fact that it's a 'newer' car and that the RSX is supposedly a lame duck; she keeps cars ten years, after all. But, in her defense, she felt better in the RSX, the dash is definitely less fussy, controls more user friendly (and she's 4'11"", so reachability is an issue) and the RSX has leather (big mistake not offering it in upper Civics, IMO).Oh yeah, both the Honda and Acura dealers offered her $3k in trade on her Integra. It's only got 35k but does have a couple issues (pretty seriously oxidized paint, a bit of the usual rust on both rear wheelwells, fussy driver's window switch, glitchy power locks), but the interior is decent, the stereo, antenna, windows and roof work fine and the air is ICE cold. Runs great, too (I drove all day); reminds me, especially on the interstate, why I'd never get a 4-cylinder automatic, though; had to plan those passing maneuvers, definitely. She doesn't want to sell it on her own (she's single, 4'11"" and 62 years old, I don't blame her), she's got a friend interested in it for her teenager (perfect!), but if that doesn't work out, it will be traded. She'd also get the tax savings on the trade (~$200, big deal). "

"ghulet","October 2005"," Yeah, it is kind of strange to see a woman her age driving an Integra or RSX. She's single, her son is long since married (he was one of my best childhood friends), so she doesn't really need 'practical' (though the hatchback has come in handy many times, she says). She had an '86 Accord before the Integra, and, would you believe a '79 Grand Marquis before that? Her cars are getting younger.Fin, the condition, I guess, isn't as bad as I make it sound; it's a great '20 footer', as they say. The rust on the wheelwells is very minor, no holes and it's only visible up close; the oxidation is visible, kinda looks like frost, probably the result of the combination of extremes we get here in weather, and the fact that it's a dark color.

"corvette","October 2005"," It's funny you mention that... Right after the Freestyle came out, I saw one on the interstate filled up with stuff, and the low-hanging tailpipe was about to drag the ground! Did I ever post my theory on the 1996-generation Explorer rollovers? This may have no scientific basis, but here goes: I noticed a ton of Explorers that, when traveling at interstate speed, would ""lean"" backwards--the rear end of the truck would squat down close to the ground. Perhaps they were carrying a lot of cargo, but it doesn't make sense, given the number of these that I saw. I suspect that some combination of bad aerodynamics pushed the rear of the car down too hard at high speed, placing more weight than was intended on the rear axle. Carrying rear passengers or cargo would only compound this effect. Perhaps this was intended to provide additional rear traction and stability to prevent oversteer, but became dangerous when the car was loaded down. With the rear axle loaded down in this manner, the tires are probably above their weight limits at the recommended pressure (26 psi?), and are being subjected to more impact harshness and stress when driving over pockmarked pavement due to the reduced suspension travel caused by the loading of the live rear axle. This is the perfect recipe for overloading and blowing out a rear tire, which is very likely to result in a loss of control. Also, the lack of downward force on the front end of the car would make it much harder to steer, making it easier to lose control... So, did I earn my pseudo-expert witness badge with that? :P "

With the extension of the platform to allow for a third row seat it will have (optional), I figure it will be about as big as the current Highlander, which is bigger than I would like. The thing is, the current model is so maneuverable because it has such a short wheelbase, which is why I like it.

"andre1969","October 2005"," was interested in the RAV4, until someone at his job badmouthed it. The parents of one of his co-workers has one, and supposedly she borrowed it a few times, and ragged on how slow it was. She said that when you turn the a/c on, out on the highway, it really kills the car's power. Well, the same thing happens to my buddy's Tracker when he turns the a/c on, so it gave him enough of a deja vu to cross it off his list!But doesn't the RAV4 have a Camry engine in it? Seems to me that should be enough to power something like a RAV. And incidentally, another vehicle on his list is the Element. But since that one has an Accord engine, which is about the same size/power as the Camry, it seems to me that theoretically it would have the same problem with a/c!Anyway, I told him that he should at least try the RAV out, but he won't listen. Still, even if the a/c does kill the car's power, I'm sure it's still gotta perform better than his Tracker would! "
"stickguy","October 2005"," I'm doing this from memory, but I think it has a 2.0l engine, more of a COrolla than Camry level. The Highlander uses the Camry 2.4l as the base engine. "
"nippononly","October 2005"," that 2.4 is the RAV's only engine,and yes it is the Camry engine. The difference between Element and RAV is about 500 pounds in the AWD. The Element is a porker, and fuel economy suffers proportionally. When I test drive, I make a practice of leaving the A/C on the entire time, even if it is chilly out. Gives you an idea of how much the power suffers with it on. The RAV is plenty spritely enough with it running, I wouldn't call it slow. It is geared about the same as my RSX, and has about the same torque-to-weight ratio (is there such a thing?!), so it feels peppy on the street and has decent passing power at highway speeds. "
"paulhuang","October 2005"," I think the first generation RAV4 had a 2.0 liter engine. I can see how that can be totally sapped on the highway with the AC on. The current ones have a 2.4 liter engine, so it should be fine on power. "

"andre1969","October 2005"," I'm probably looking at this from a different perspective, but so far the only SUV I've seen with what I'd consider an adult-useable back seat is the Ford Excursion! :P "

"andre1969","October 2005"," you have to take those legroom numbers with a grain of salt, although the Explorer does stack up awfully well to the Excursion, at least in published measures. Still, it's funny how actually sitting in the car, large discrepancies can come up. For example, when the stats were first published for the Chrysler LX cars, they listed front legroom at 41.8"", which had me worried. My '00 Intrepid is rated at 42.2"", which is just barely adequate...in fact, I wish the seat would go back further! So if 42.2"" barely cuts it, I figured losing a half-inch off that would be a dealbreaker. But imagine my shock when I sat in one, and it felt like the seat went back a lot further than in my Intrepid! But then the Camry is rated at something like 41.8"", and it feels tight to me.Sometimes a taller seat will give you more legroom in the way they measure it, but you still might end up being closer to the seatback in front of you. Plus, as you sit higher, your legs will extend outward more horizontally, instead of upward, requiring more room behind the front seatback for your legs.Is that 39"" measurement for front seat legroom correct for the Freestyle?! I don't think I've seen a measurement that small since your typical early 70's Japanese subcompact! :surprise: "
"bobw3","October 2005"," I know what you mean about the numbers. Plus for rows 2 & 3, I don't know if those are measured with the seat in front fully forward, or back or where? Maybe you could go to a dealer and go into each of vehicles and let us know for real! "
"andre1969","October 2005"," to do that sometime. Honestly, I don't think I've been in a Freestyle other than at the auto show, and there they had the power disconnected so I couldn't get the front seat comfy. The only time I sat in an Excursion was when I saw one on a local CarMax lot. I was impressed that I could sit in the middle row and the third row, and not have my knees touch the seatback in front of me. Still, with something that huge, I guess you should expect that! I was actually a bit disappointed up front though. I just figured something that size would have more legroom up front!And, now that I think about it, I don't think I've tried out all the seating positions of the Explorer. The previous generation used to seem cramped to me, but the new one seems okay up front. I haven't tried out the 3rd row seat though, and can't remember how the middle row was. "

He occupied the second row, she took the back row and had one seat folded down in the second row so she could stretch out. Neither kid really complained about space (or the lack thereof) for the 1500 mile round trip.In fact, when we first looked at the Explorer, we had both our daughter and her best friend sit in the third row and comment on its comfort. At the time, we were driving the previous generation Expedition, and both of them thought it compared well.

Soon thereafter I saw a picture of a '57 DeSoto, and fell in love with it. Found one for sale about an hour and a half away, and bought it back in 1990, when I was still in college. Funny, but I was in college, no job, but seemed like I had more money back then! 1968 Dodge Dart 270: I had been driving a '69 Dart GT that was a great all-round car...decent blend of performance/economy with the pre-smog Slant six it had, good interior room up front, huge trunk, reliable. Well, it got totaled, and the next day I found this 270. It was a totally different beast from the GT though, because it had a mildly hopped-up V-8. Much faster, much thirstier, and not nearly as reliable. MUCH higher mileage, though, with around 253,000 miles on it when I bought it, versus around 77,000 on the GT when I totaled it.1967 Pontiac Catalina convertible: something I always wanted ever since I was a little kid. Saw one at a used car lot, oddly enough, while cruising around after a Mopar show.2000 Dodge Intrepid: Probably got lured in by the 0.9% financing more than anything else, but at the time it was probably the best car out there that fit my needs. An Accord, Camry, and especially an Altima were too small back then. You probably couldn't have paid me to drive a Taurus. And I didn't like the style/interior/comfort of the Impala.1979 Chrysler New Yorker 5th Ave: I used to have a '79 Newport that I loved, and, piece of junk that it was, I always missed it after I got rid of it. So when I found this NYer on eBay, I just had to have it1985 Silverado: Granddad bought it new, and a few years after he died, Grandmom gave it to my Mom. Mom bought a new F-150 a few years back, and passed it down to me.1976 Pontiac Grand LeMans: something else I've always wanted ever since I was a little kid. I think ""Smokey and the Bandit"" turned me on to these big '76-77 LeManses.So, some of my automotive choices haven't exactly been logic-based! :P "
"anonymousposts","October 2005"," ""What does anyone here own?""2004 Honda Accord EX-L - bought because we needed a mid-size for the baby and the Accord 5-speed manual is the best in the business (disclaimer: IMO).2003 Civic Si - bought because Gee wanted a commuter with good performance and gas mileage. Has lived up to both of those with close to 40,000 miles on it.2004 Honda Odyssey - bought because we needed something a little bigger than the Accord for the first few years. It has come in handy and we will miss it when the lease ends in 6 months.1994 Lexus LS400 - bought because it was a good deal back in 2001 and Gee wanted to get out of his less than perfect 2000 Silverado. Now we keep it around for the basement spiders to have a place to live. "

"andre1969","October 2005"," the garage is coming along pretty quickly now, although it's raining, so I know that's going to slow things down. The crew came out on Wednesday afternoon to start erecting it, and by yesterday afternoon all the framing, roof trusses, and roof sheathing were up.It's supposed to rain today and tomorrow, and possibly Sunday, so I have a feeling the crew is going to pack up and come back on Monday to try and finish up. So it's getting there! At least it's more than just 18 holes in the ground like it had been for awhile...we were joking that I had a golf course out there! "
"michaellno","October 2005"," Saturn VUE AWD V6 - wife likes the visibility of an SUV, refuses to be seen in a minivan (and with the kids driving themselves, it's not all that necessary), plus the ground clearance comes in handy during the winter months. Oh, and did I mention that it comes with the 3.5L Honda V6 with 250HP? Vroom! 13K miles currently.Ford Focus ZX5 - had a lease on an Explorer; Ford sent us a notice indicating that they would pay off the remainder of the lease if we bought or leased another Ford. Took 4 dealers to find the right car in the right color with the right equipment. Nearly doubled the MPG (from 16 to 30+) and halved the payment (from $580 to $320 per month). Like Jolie, the Focus has done everything we've asked of it and more. Has 32K miles on it.Saturn L300 V6 - was looking for a 4 door sedan with a V6, leather, sunroof. Like Andre, I was probably swayed more by the deal rather than the car - in this case, 0% for 60 months. Combined with my GM Supplier discount, the Saturn was anywhere from $2000 to $4000 less than anything else I was looking at (Accord, Altima, Passat). Also got 4 wheel disc brakes, ABS, TC, climate control, advanced audio (subwoofer) - essentially, fully loaded for $24K. Has about 43-45K miles on it (don't know exactly, stepdaughter drives it mostly). "
"fintail","October 2005"," 1998 MB C43 - 55K, in pretty much new condition. Intoxicating exhaust note and speed along with tolerable economy. A very neat little car that makes me look forward to my commute, even the one going to work. Many people think it cost 2 or 3 times what I paid, too.1964 MB 220 SE - 247K, in very good original condition, that I have had since I was a teenager. It's a late series injected fintail with dual circuit discs, 4 speed auto, etc. It doesn't have many issues for something its age, and the FI makes it very reliable. I also had a 1989 MB 300SE, 182K, a 6cyl S class, that I had to sell when the C43 came along. It was a beautifully maintained car in the best colors, that always got compliments from MB people. I had a buyer lined up even before I was ready to sell. "
"jaserb","October 2005"," 2004 Mazda MPV. 17k miles. It's the perfect size, looks great, drives well, and was cheap as dirt. It was advertised in the paper at $8k under sticker - roughly $1500 under invoice at the time, even once all the rebates were factored in. On top of that we got an overallowance on our trade in - about $2k over what Terry told me to expect, due in part to the UC appraiser assuming it was 4WD when it wasn't. To their credit, they didn't try to unwind the deal - by the time we figured it out the papers were signed. A screaming deal on the perfect vehicle for us - that doesn't happen too often. 1992 Dodge Ram 50 4x4. 166k miles. Great little beater truck. I bought it for $1500 a little over a year ago with a bad clutch (that I knew about) and a tranny that was about to grenade (that I didn't.) I put in a new clutch and a junkyard tranny in it for about $800 and I've put about 10k miles on it since as my daily driver. Perfect for hauling mountain bikes, mulch, etc. I've thought about replacing it, but I've kind of become attached to the 'lil red beast. The A/C even works!1974 Alfa Romeo Spider. In lots of pieces in my garage - by Spring I'll have it put together again. Maybe.-Jason "
"scanty","October 2005"," 1994 300ZX Convertible, leased new then purchased. 125,000 miles and still looks and runs great. Been tempted to let it go in order to get something newer (S2000, 350Z, G35 Coupe) but I think I'll keep it. Not good CCBA activity, but it's too rare, and too much fun. 1999.5 Pathfinder, bought used (on ebay from a guy in Brooklyn) in 2002. It's a great truck. Nearly bulletproof. Coming up on 100,000 miles and going strong. 16.5 mpg isn't great, but my commute is less than 5 miles each way. If it headed downhill, I'd probably be looking at '01-'04 Pathfinders and QX4's, or maybe a new CR-V. "
"bumpy","October 2005"," I'll just list everything:1980 Chevrolet Citation- built in April 1979, V6 automatic, ex-Grandma car. I learned to drive in that old beast in 1993, handed it down to my sister when I went to college, and my brother started to learn to drive it when it popped a seal and dumped out the tranny fluid all over the exhaust around 80k.1988 Nissan Sentra- bought it in 1995 with 196k on the clock, learned to drive stick in it, changed the oil once in 1996, got it run into a few times, replaced the entire front suspension in stages, popped the head gasket in 2002, and finally called the junkyard to get it in 2003.1991 Isuzu pickup- bought it in 2000 as a backup for the Sentra. Has the old they-made-them-that-late? carburated 2.3L, heavy springs, and a sagging front bumper that my dad attributed to the previous owner's ""parking by braille"" technique.2000 Hyundai Accent- bought it to replace the Sentra in 2002. Drives and handles like the Sentra (since Hyundai basically cloned the B12/13 underpinnings). I did put a short-throw shifter in it last year and splurged on some 14"" alloys this summer.1992 Nissan Sentra SE-R- bought it last year from an ad in the paper, as I was in the mood to scratch a sport compact performance itch. 228k on the clock and it still pulls like it was new.1966 GMC 1500 pickup- my lawnmower doesn't fit in the Isuzu, so I needed a full-size pickup. I didn't want to deal with the byzantine under-hood setups on newer trucks, liked the styling of the early-60s GM trucks, and wanted something different than a regular old small-block V8; so I bought a longbed 3/4-ton (1/2-ton GMCs were model 1000 in those days) pickup with the uncommon close-ratio NP435 4-speed and a 351 c.i. big-block V6 (the motor weighs close to 900 pounds).

"michaellno","October 2005"," Could I get your opinion on this:Worth a one-way trip to Chicago?This is the same engine as your C-class, correct? "
"fintail","October 2005"," Well, it's fully loaded, and you don't often see ones so red. It looks pretty nice, and it looks to be just at retail for one in nice shape. It looks to have the AMG package, which is a good dress up item. The car has the moonroof, so it should also have the rain sensing wipers, which I think are cool.The engine is based on the same as the C43, but the C43 has AMG intake/exhaust/cam/transmission tuning etc. I think it's 30-40 hp up on the normal 4.3. The interior is very similar, I recognize a lot of that car...the steering wheel is even the same design.It's a fairly solid unit ...only issues I know of on the C43 are some reports of harmonic balancer problems, which MB has quietly had a recall issue with. So if it fails, you aren't completely out of luck. MB claims/lies about these cars having a lifetime transmission that never needs servicing, but the car should have it serviced anyway by 70K miles. I took mine in for a service and the tech guy scoffed and said it was a lifetime unit - I countered by asking if it was then warranteed for life...he then agreed with my idea of servicing it. Just make sure the car has been maintained and has some kind of records, if you are serious about it. "
"akangl","October 2005"," Had to take the Titan in to have the E-brake adjusted (hubby messed it up back in June.........cost me $40.28), so while I was waiting on it I wandered around the used car lot (big mistake). Found a NICE (did I mention it was NICE??) 2001 Ford F-250 CC SB XLT 4x4 V10, probably the cleanest used truck I've ever seen, the bed hasn't been used, its clean under the truck, the engine, interior, still smells new. Definatly not a truck that's ever seen work. Has about 51,600 miles on it (I'd swear it was more like 5100). Drove GREAT, everything works, no problems found. Dealer is asking $24,995 but the GSM immediatly dropped the price to $21,712. He offered $26k for my truck (trade is $26,600).Talked it over with hubby and he said to call them back tomorrow and see if they have another $2k or so to play with.......if so then we'll do it. I'm thinking they might just to move the truck (V10 in times of $2.80/gallon gas). Our Dodge V10 averages 9.5 mpg, my Titan averages 13.5 mpg, I think the Ford V10 will fall somewhere between the 2 which is fine with me.ARGH, I KNOW better than to wander the used car lot with Jeff (my favorite salesguy). Good thing the Titan rarely breaks anything anymore.Also touched bases with my Ford salesguy in Anchorage, he's got a new 04 diesel that he's willing to take a loser deal on to move it. Said he would call me back Monday evening, when he works next to give me the numbers.I keep telling myself to wait another year, but everytime I have to overload the Titan I think that I'm better off to cut my losses now and get a bigger truck. This weekend is gonna be rough.........have to do 11 cords of firewood............both the Dodge and Titan must work hard.......along with their owners.  "
"racer63","October 2005"," Here we go:1986 Honda Civic Si. Bought used in 1992 with 97,000 miles on it. Driven as a street and weekend autocross car until 140,000 miles in January 1995, which by then the input shaft bearing had gone bad in the tranny. Taken off the road and reinvented as a race prepared Auto-x car that summer. Now sits as a spare shelf in the garage, but will likely see competition duty again next spring.2000 Toyota Celica GT Bought new in March 2000, and currently has 91,000 miles. It replaced a '95 Jetta GLX the day the extended warranty ran out on the VW. Not a coincidence. It was bought for a the same purpose the Honda was in '92. Daily drive and weekend fun car, a mission which in hindsight it has filled well. This particualr vintage Celica does have some well-documented weaknesses, but the only one afflicting me has been tranny woes, of which I am on No. 3, fortunately all covered under powertrain warranty. The current one shifts like a charm, with no crunches, whines, or blocked shifts like the first 2. All in all, this car is kind of like a spouse; a few annoying quirks but worthwhile to keep over the long term. I'm in the market to buy something, but this car will likely stick around.2004 GMC Sierra 2500HD Crew Cab The ultimate family truckster. In spring '04 I had a '99 Exploder V8. a '95 29' Motorhome, and an open car trailer, to do regular family of 4 car and weekend duty. The Exploder was costing $500-1000 to fix semi-regularly on stupid quality related stuff. (Ball Joints, Steering Rack, etc.). The RV was making me nervous on having even more expensive things go wrong with it. And the open car trailer was a PIT* to load and unload. So the household CFO gave me pemission to Sell Everything. After the RV went (for almost what I paid for it 3 years prior!), we bought this truck. Since we didn't need or want a third seat, the pick-up does what we need well, and I don't have to worry about dirtying up the back. Just hose it out. It has a 1-ton chassis and running gear, and even with only the 6.0 gas motor, tows my new 8000lb all loaded up enclosed trailer just fine at 70 mph, getting 9-9.5 mpg, which isn't all that bad. Around town, it gets the same as the Exploder. Oh, and 0% for 60 months. Can't beat free money, though I don't want to know how upside down I probably am 15 months into the deal. My wife daily drives this, and loves being the queen of the soccer fields. This one will stay around a while.So that leaves me to my next purchase, which currently has me leaning in the direction of am '03-'05 E46 BMW 330i, with the ZHP Performance Package. More hp, higher redline, better suspension, and shorter rear gears. This may be a tugh find, but I like the pre-Bangle cars' looks better. A 2 year old example CPO should be a somewhat reasonable deal too. I plan on having fun looking. "
"woodyww","October 2005"," The V10 is not the Diesel, right? From what you've said about wanting the Diesel, & what I've read about the Ford Diesel, I'd hold out for that. I think it might pay off even if it costs a few thousand more up-front......just one opinion. "

Our total debt would go down by over $10k also.Its not a bad deal, just have to get the dealer to agree to my terms, will work on that tomorrow since my goofy salesguy forgot to call back.........he forgets my name, forgets to call back, lol, good thing I kinda like him. :P "

Also, a few weeks ago you loved the Titan so much you couldn't bear to give it up......& the dealer may be dying to get rid of a V10 truck that gets 10 mpg.

"akangl","October 2005"," We have been discussing for a long time, parking the Titan was mainly due to $$$ at the time, however, that's over with.I owe way too much on the Titan (am embarrassed to say, lol), but when it comes down to it I'm about $7k in the hole.

One of the main streets near my house has a 40 mph speed limit. Because it's a 6 lane street with a turning lane in the middle, people will travel at 50 mph most of the time. I see cars getting tickets quite often. All I do is flip on the cruise and sit back. I haven't had a speeding ticket since 1985. Got a warning in Texas in 1996 doing 70 in a 65. The cop was in a Mustang police car and just wanted to stop me and my buddy just to see what we were doing and where we were going. I had rented a 1996 Lincoln Town Car, white, and was driving just slightly over the speed limit. My radar detector went off and I hit the cancel on the cruise.... he stopped me anyway. The cop separated us to see if our stories were matching; I sat in the front seat of the Mustang cop car and my friend was in the front passenger seat in the rental. We were driving to California to check on an investment property and thought a drive would be fun. I don't use a radar detector anymore, the speed limit works for me.Mark "

"akangl","October 2005"," Akangl, I read on another thread that you were looking at GMC truck, are you still considering it? You mentioned that it had been wrecked so I guess the price would reflect that. Nope, they said the truck had never been wrecked, yeah right, even hubby spotted the new parts. The front fenders had definatly been off, it had new wheel well linings, new paint on the front clip, new headlights, grille, and a new bumper. They offered $22k for the Titan but would not budge off the $19,995 for the GMC. So basically they wanted to give me the GMC and $2k for my Titan...........uh no. The GMC had a trade in of $18k (loan value is $16k), the Titan has a trade in of $26k (loan value of $23,5), so I was thinking more along the lines of $22k for my truck and $16k for thier truck..........in other words they give me the GMC and $6k for my truck. I think I was being generous considering that GMC truely has no value being wrecked and canadian.Ah well, they can keep it, I'll keep plugging along with the Titan (at least I know its American and hasn't been wrecked). I can concievably buy out the lease in the spring if I want to, but am going to wait to see what the used car market does, I may just buy a beater truck and park the Titan after our vacation until the miles are in line, then turn it in at the end of the lease. We are already at 21k miles, only allowed 48k through the whole lease. "
"andre1969","October 2005"," Woodyww, here's a rough breakdown of what this garage has cost me so far...$15,000: what the pole barn company gets, includes materials, labor, drilling the holes, etc. I'm not doing it myself, but after watching the crew put it up, it really doesn't look like it would've been that hard to do. Still, I can get impatient and frustrated, so it was probably best to just pay to have it done. They came out on Wednesday afternoon, the 7th, worked all day the 8th, morning on the 9th,came back in the afternoon on Columbus day, and were finished the day after around 5:00$800: 2 dumptruck loads of gravel$233: the permit to build the thing$50: a bribe fee I had to pay to the county to get a ""tree conservation"" letter, which basically gives me permission to cut down trees on my own property. Nevermind the fact that neither I, nor my ancestors, had to get permission to let the things grow up in the first place! :mad: $600: to have an engineer come out and draw up a new plan and certify it when the footer holes filled up with groundwater and the building inspector failed it.$1300: for the concrete that's already been poured in the footer holes, plus the work that the guy doing the grading and such has done so far.So, as it sits right now, it's just a shade under $18,000. I'm guessing it'll be another $4000 or so to finish up with the grading/filling, slab, and gravel driveway. So once it's all said and done, I'm guessing it'll run maybe $22-23K. Naturally, it ended up running more than I thought it would (don't most home projects?  ) And I haven't even thought about electricity yet...I'll cross that bridge when I get to it! Plus, if the need arises, I have enough extension cords to reach out to the garage. It's about 150 feet from the house.The main thing I wanted, for the time being at least, is something to keep my cars out of the weather. I have my '57 DeSoto and '76 LeMans crammed in my grandmother's garage. My '67 Catalina convertible is sitting under a 10x20 car canopy. And my '79 NYer is currently in the shop, but normally just sits out in the yard. So, once all these are garaged, I guess I have to go buy something to fill up my grandmother's garage, plus a few new yard ornaments! :P "
"woodyww","October 2005"," Sounds like a lot of garage for the $$--what are the dimensions? And is it any more difficult to add electricity after the fact? You'll probably need it, in case you want to go out & futz around with your cars at night.....at least I would. And get plenty of outlets all over, plus at least one outside light. Then there's are the cool wall-storage systems you can get now. (I have garage-envy).cheers, woody "
"andre1969","October 2005"," it's 24x40 feet overall (not counting the T-111 siding). One the inside, it ends up being 22'10"" x 39'2"" inside the 4x6 poles. It uses pole barn construction, versus the regular type of framing that the typical garage or house uses, and is supposed to be cheaper than frame construction.I never did price a frame building, though, so I don't have anything to go by as a reference. Back in 2003 my Mom and stepdad had a 24x28 garage built and it ended up costing around $19,000 for everything. That included a brick front, vinyl siding, electricity, nicer windows (mine are kinda trailer park-ish, although they look like they're actually double-pane) and a 9 foot interior height...I think mine will come in at a bit over 8 feet once the slab's poured.But then, my Mom is in a different county, and their garage was built by Mennonites or Amish or some similar group that tends to charge a lower labor rate. And I'm sure labor rates and construction materials have gone up since 2003, especially with the housing boom and such. I've heard that concrete in particular has really skyrocketed.Still, I'm happy with it. Originally I was going to go with a 30x40 gambrel barn with a loft, but the county shot that one down real fast. They have a silly little restriction here that no secondary buildings can have more square footage than the primary structure. This 30x40 building would've had 1200 square feet (thy didn't count the loft) but they only had my house down as having 1106 square feet. It's actually more like 1500, but they don't count my enclosed side porch, and they consider it a 1 1/2 story, so they only count half of the upstairs square footage.They also had a height restriction of 15 feet for any secondary buildings. However, on cape cod style buildings, they took the measurement half way up the roof. On gambrel style buildings, they'd take the measurement where the steeper plane of the roof meets the flatter plane, which on my original plan came in at 17 feet. So back to the drawing board I went! Annoyingly enough, the second time I went in to apply for the permit, using the plans for the building I have now, they told me that they changed the way they measure height. Turns out too many people were building cape cods and then bumping the upstairs out with massive dormers, in effect making a complete second story. So they just gave up and decided to change the height cap to 20 feet. By that time though, I was fed up enough that I wasn't about to go and get a THIRD design drawn up! :mad:I don't think electricity will be too hard to do after the fact, because the inside of the garage is just a shell, so it's not like there's any drywall to tear out or anything. The worst part would probably be having to dig a trench from the house all the way down to the garage to run the electric. But then, there's a utility pole about 90 feet from the garage, out at the street, so it may be worth it to just run a separate meter/circuit breaker box and just not have it tie into the house at all.

He turns off at a intersection and about a quarter mile later I get pulled over. Cop couldn't give me a ticket because he hadn't actually clocked my car but the Cav. Told me to slow down. Too late.

"andre1969","October 2005"," having moved from a 1250 square foot condo to a 1500 square foot house, I sure found a way to fill it fast! One problem though, was that the condo had plenty of attic space and a 1 car garage. The house has a very low, flat roof, and while there is attic space, I don't use it because it's too hard to get up in there. Still, it's amazing how fast the house got filled. Oh almost forgot...I did get another roommate, a dog, and another cat, so that accounts for part of the additional clutter!In addition to the 24x40 garage I'm building though, there are two other buildings on the property. One of them is about 10x20, and used to be a garage back in the old days. It needs a lot of work though, and I'm torn right now between trying to fix it up, or just tear it down. There's also a 12x16 building with a tin roof and sides that's still structurally sound, but does need to be re-roofed and animal proofed. Both of these buildings are pretty full of stuff that many generations of my ancestors have been collecting and hoarding over the decades, and a lot of it is probably worthless by now.I am thinking about building a small room off the back of the tin building, maybe bumping it out to 12x24 or 12x30 or something, and then doing a lean-to on the side for a carport. I'm going to try hard to keep the junk and clutter out of the new garage, but we'll see how long that lasts!  "

"fintail","October 2005"," That bugs me to no end, seeing perfectly good garages going to waste. People do have too much crap.

My mother still has 6000 sq ft of clutter in a 2000 sq ft house, and that's after 5 years in an antique mall and several garage sales. A covered car is worth more to me.

"akangl","October 2005"," I know I've bounced back and forth on this, I'm so undecided as to the fate of my beloved truck. I really do love the darn thing, but we could do so much more if we had a 3/4 ton or 1 ton. We still have 30 cords of firewood to deliver (have to go get it first). Did 6 cords yesterday, but could only bring out 5, very frustrating!We are going to the Nissan dealer (again) and hubby is going to look over that 01 F-250 V10. I figure if he's there they will stand up and take notice...........he's never with me, usually I do the numbers and he comes in and signs. If he's there they know they could have a deal that day.

"michaellno","October 2005"," Over the weekend, I was perusing the on-line ads and found what might be a good car for the daughter.2002 Chevy Malibu LS, 55K, 3.1L V6, power everything, ABS, keyless remote, alloy wheels. Dark grey with grey cloth interior. Asking $9400.So, today at lunch I stopped by the dealer to take a closer look. Body looks straight, but the front tires were BF Goodrich (fairly new) and the rears were Goodyears (pretty worn).Car drove pretty nicely ... no major body issues, A/C blew cold, no sqeaks or rattles anywhere, everything seemed to work fine. Edmunds TMV, Kelley Blue Book and Intellichoice all price the car around what the dealer is asking. Told the salesman about what I was looking for (car for daughter, can't drive a stick, would be trading in the Focus).He, of course, thinks that we can do a deal ... I'm hoping to keep the payments around 300/mo for 36 months. Research on the Focus pegs the trade in value between $7300 and $7900 .. I owe something like $9K, so we'd have to figure out how to deal with that.We did take a look in the owners manual and it says that the transmission fluid is to be changed at 50K; at 60K, the only issue above LOF and tire rotation is to check the accessory drive belt (?). I would want the tire situation addressed and the transmission service done before going any further.Of course, all of this is contingent on getting the buy in from both Mrs. Michaell and the daughter.(NOTE: I washed the Saturn over the weekend and noticed that it only has 42.5K on it, which means that the daughter has put only 2000 miles on the car in the last 4 months - with the Chevy at 55K, I figure she'll put - maybe - 20-25K on the car in the next three years at most, and that's if she goes to college at her first choice, which is about an 80 mile drive from where we live.)I mentioned the Malibu to the wife briefly over the weekend and her first comment was that the daughter didn't want a Malibu. Perhaps she might reconsider? "

Again, no ABS available.stickguy - as much as I'd like to ""stick"" her with the Focus (pun intended), I don't really have a huge problem driving it for the time being.

"michaellno","October 2005"," Nope, a lot of the '04 Classics for sale in and around Denver offer the 2.2L 4-cylinder engine.And, in my research, I found I was wrong on the HP .. for 2002, the 3.1L V6 offered 170HP, not the 155 that I thought. So, not much less than the 182HP I have in the L300 .. the only difference is that the Saturn's engine is an overhead cam, while the Malibu is an overhead valve -- very noticable when you step on the throttle. At least, to me it's noticable.Mentioned the Malibu to my wife, who says I have to talk to daughter. Will do that tonight after she gets off work ... perhaps I can convince her to come to dealership tomorrow and take a closer look (she's on fall break from HS this week and is not working tomorrow).I think my biggest concern now is getting the most for the trade in of the Focus ... I can get the $$ to cover the difference (split between us and kid), but the smaller that number is, the better. The salesman wanted me to have the Focus appraised today while I was at the dealer, but I begged off until I had the chance to talk to the family about it.Insurance actually works out in our favor ... daughter would save $22/month on her insurance payment, according to State Farm.

"gsemike","October 2005"," Around here in NY, I see those Malibus real cheap. Now that 2006 is upon us, won't that same money get you into a 2002 4 cyl Accord or Camry? I haven't shopped for a Malibu lately, but isn't $7,500 about right? "
"andre1969","October 2005"," Michaell, I'm not sure, but I think the 3.1 in the '97-99 Malibu had 155 hp, and it was bumped to 170 hp for 2000. The '97-99 actually had a 2.4 DOHC inline 4 standard, with 150 hp. It was basically a watered-down, but more reliable version of the Olds Quad 4.I had a 2001 Malibu rental a few years back. Its 3.1 was decent around town, and acceleration for merging onto a highway was okay, but highway passing was poor. It just seemed to get winded once you got up around 70-75 mph.Even though the L-series 3.0 only has 182 hp, I'm guessing it has a much better torque/power curve. I think I've seen 0-60 times of around 7 seconds for the L-series V-6, versus a more mundane 8.8 or so for the Malibu 3.1. "
"gsemike","October 2005"," My bad on the pricing. I did a quick search on Auto Trader and that seems like a good price. One buick dealer with notoriously high prices on his used cars actually had a few low mileage examples for $13,995. By the end of the run for that car, I don't think that you could go over $15,000 loaded for a new one so why would you go that high for a used one?The prices on used Accords are astronomical. V6 2002 models are close to 20 large. I know that these cars are in demand but if you figure it was about 25k new, it should have lost more than 20% of it's value in almost 4 years. "
"michaellno","October 2005"," The wife and I talked about it more last night ... basically, it comes down to trading in a 2003 MY car with 32K miles for a 2002 MY car with 55K miles and paying more for it doesn't seem like a smart move. The wife would rather go the new car route if we did anything.So, it looks like I'll be driving the Focus for a while longer ... however, when the Saturn Sky is released next year, perhaps the Focus might go at that time!But, I also have to say that I've been admiring the Ford Fusion lately ... perhaps a loaded SEL 4-cylinder with a stick shift might work.

Most of the cars are coming with ABS, which I like.4-cylinders are running around $20-21K; most of the SE trim level V6's are going for $22-23K, with a few loaded models in the $25-26K range. "

After the so so showing of the 500, Ford needs this model to make some noise. While the 500 is pretty blah, there's something about the look of the montego that I think is pretty snazzy.

"michaellno","October 2005"," Agreed, but the MPG numbers for the Accord 4-cylinder with automatic are 24 city and 34 hwy, while the Fusion V6 is rated at 21 city, 29 hwy.(For comparison's sake, the Fusion 4-cyl with auto has an EPA rating of 24/32, while the Accord V6 auto gets 20/29)Now, I'm not dissing on the Accord -- I've owned three of them in the past (an '85 LX hatchback, a '92 LX sedan and a '93 DX sedan) -- but I've come to believe that Honda isn't the be-all, end-all when it comes to cars. It seems as if Honda is fairly arrogant in their pricing -- sort of BMW-like, in a way.The exterior design, over the years, has fluctuated wildly, but that's more of a personal issue than anything else. The interior design is about as ergonomically perfect as can be, but I guess I'd also describe it as .... dull. The Fusion, OTOH, looks pretty good to me, both inside and out (at least, based on the pictures I've seen). While Ford is probably not quite at Honda levels of interior quality, it's pretty close.Anyway, as my lovely bride says, ""that's why they make chocolate and vanilla ice cream"" ... so's you have a choice. Some folks wouldn't touch the Ford with a 10 foot poll; others wouldn't be caught dead in the Honda, for whatever reason. "

Well, you are close (I'm impressed). We are selling our 18' car hauler trailer, BUT, we purchased a 12' 14k lb GVWR dump trailer. That way, we load it, pull up to someone's house, get out and push a button.......*POOF* its unloaded. We've been wanting to get one for a long time, but there wasn't a heavy duty enough one out. Yesterday we stopped by our favorite trailer dealer and the owner came out of her office and told us about the new trailers she just got in. We thought about it overnight and went back today to buy it. Dern thing weighs 3820 lbs by itself, our 18' car hauler trailer only weighs 2600 lbs empty.I'll pick it up on Thursday with the Titan, plus I am taking our 18' trailer up to be put on consignment at the trailer dealer. She said it should sell quickly and we should see an easy $3k for it. Not too bad considering its 2 years old and we paid $4195 for it.........it don't owe us anything, its hauled enough firewood to pay for itself 2 or 3 times over. "
"michaellno","October 2005"," OK, so I'm not getting a ""new"" used car for the daughter to replace the Focus. Perhaps I should just think about trading in the Focus for a ""new"" new car for Dad.Which is why I was at the Ford dealer at lunch today test driving a Fusion SE V6. It was dark red with the camel cloth interior. ABS was included, sticker price was just a tick over $22K.First impression - it is a really handsome car. The pictures I've seen don't seem to do it justice. The aggressive grille, especially. The lines are just right and it is well proportioned. Larger than I would have thought, since it is based on the Mazda 6. The trunk is absolutely huge.Interior was a mixed bag. While lots of nice materials were used, there were many conflicting colors to be found. Upper dash and door panels were one color, lower dash and center console area another color, mixed with black touches (steering wheel and audio/AC controls) made it look, well, odd to me. While I thought I would be attracted to the camel interior, it was too bright, almost gold colored. Instrumentation was nice, and the multi-function steering wheel is a welcome sight, though I would prefer it to be leather wrapped.The test drive was fairly short and included only city streets, but the engine and transmission seem to work well together. Suspension handled the broken pavement nicely. Superb turning radius, for what it's worth.Told salesman to give me a call when an SEL, 5-speed 4-cylinder hits the lots so that I can drive one in comparison. 17"" wheels, coupled with a slightly nicer interior layout might be my cup of tea. Would also like to drive one with a sunroof to see if I fit. "
"corvette","October 2005"," I kind of like two-tone interiors. I would love to have beige leather(ette) with black carpet, so that the carpet doesn't get stained. In the meantime, I have ""solar collector"" solid black.I absolutely hate two-tone exteriors, though. One of my friends had a Tahoe that was navy with this hideous gold stripe at the bottom. I liked the special-edition RX300 that was solid red, but not the standard models. The loaded Kia Sportage and Sorento (EX?) would look so much better without the two-tone paint, though I don't think that would get me to buy one! "
"michaellno","October 2005"," It's not like I have anything against two (or more) colors in the interior .. or the exterior, for that matter.I owned an '88 Isuzu Trooper that was white on top and gold on the bottom, separated by a red pinstripe. Medium brown cloth interior ... it was pretty good looking.I guess my issue with the Fusion was that the tone of the colors inside didn't seem to complement one another very nicely. My opinion, of course, but the SEL interior is one color, so it might appeal to me more.OTOH, I just might say ""fark it"" and get a Scion xA for the kid. $14K vs. $21K is appealing from a financial point of view.

I can satisfy my CCB when the minivan goes back in 6 months with some cheaper used car.I'm going to the Taste of Lexus this weekend. That'll be the decision maker for me.

I met him at the trailer dealer and we dropped the 18' trailer off of my truck, he took the slide in, and they hooked up the new trailer to his truck. I was filling out consignment paperwork and walked back outside to get some info off of our 18' trailer when hubby looked at me, looked at the trailer, looked back at me, we both shook our heads. We went back inside, bought another slide in and ball, hooked the 18' trailer back up to my truck and I brought it home.Needless to say it will be staying, don't know what we will use it for (maybe a spider condo), but it will come in handy at times I'm sure. Its paid for, owes us nothing (has delivered more than enough firewood), and is a great trailer. Plus we can't replace it for what it would have been sold for (about $3500), new they are running around $5195 (a full $1k more than we paid for it 2 years ago).The tally is now 3 vehicles and 4 trailers..........I think we can stop now! :shades: "

Well, we'll see about that when it has to pull 9k+ next weekend.........poor truck!As for the amount of trailers we have.......no, we don't collect them, they all have their purpose. We have an old (73 F100) pickup bed trailer which hubby drags with him to get firewood. We have the 18' trailer which will come in handy at times. We have the new 12' dump trailer (read: save the back during unloading) which hubby will probably pull for the most part in place of the old pickup bed trailer. Then we have the travel trailer (yard ornament for the winter).Now the fun part.........we thought we were soooo smart buying that dump trailer, but the first day with it wasn't exactly a picnic. By the time hubby got to the logging road he had lost turn signals and brake lights on his truck, he went ahead and took the trailer in to the landing, loaded it, and headed out to make the delivery. He gets to the customer's house and hits the button to dump the trailer, it goes up fine, but he sees something near the hydralic pump.......bends over and about passes out from the smell of burning wires. The trailer melted its wiring. Got it dumped and back down, then came home.I took the trailer back to the dealer today, they found the problems (factory forgot to put the ground wire on), and rewired the trailer. The owner told us if we have ANY more problems she will replace the trailer with a new one. She did call the bank to see what was involved (a bunch of paperwork) and decided to have her guys fix it, then go from there. So far so good, it didn't blow any fuses on the Titan so I think its ok. :shades: "

"andre1969","October 2005"," jjtj, I'm not sure what Chrysler called that leather in the New Yorker. It was part of a special package that they called the 5th Avenue edition (instead of being its own model, the 5th Ave used to be one of those designer-type packages, like a Bill Blass Lincoln, I guess) that added about $1500 to the base price of the New Yorker. The 5th Ave also added the Driftplood accents on the inside, fake vents on the fenders, and a ""Fifth Avenue"" script in the opera windows that lit up at night. It also had those dorky wire wheels, which are now in one of my sheds...I have copcar wheels and little dog-dish hubcaps on it now! I'm guessing they just called the leather ""Designers Leather"" or something dumb like that. I remember the color scheme is called ""Designer Creme"" over ""Designer Beige"" How original.And I'm the same way when it comes to looking at houses...the first thing I look for is how big the garage is, and if there's enough room to add on to it! One of my friends has a townhouse with a garage that barely holds his Passat. Well, he recently went out and bought a Mark V. Needless to say, it won't fit! :surprise: And I guess this garage shows where my priorities are...the house could really use a new roof, new windows, paint, and a whole bunch of other work, and yet I focus on the garage!Mark, the reason they were able to build the garage this way, before a complete foundation is poured, is because technically it's a pole barn. Here's a drawing of the footer plan for it, that I had to have an engineer draw up after the drilling crew ended up hitting groundwater on just about every single hole. Originally they were just going to pour 8 inches of concrete in the bottom, but the new plan called for digging the holes deeper, putting in 12"" of gravel, and then 12"" of concrete. As for building the garage then, the crew just set the poles in, and as they started nailing up the sides that connected the poles, it ultimately stabilized itself. They also poured a little bit of concrete around the poles to hold them in place, because I guess it could flex a bit otherwise, if a strong enough wind hit it.I'm kinda curious too though, about how they're going to get more gravel in there to level the floor off though, and then pour the concrete, but the man doing it said it should be no sweat! I just hope he's right!Also, I'm glad SOMEONE thinks my collection of cars is neat. Would you guys like to come over sometime and try to convince my family to my way of thinking? :P "
"stickguy","October 2005"," just curious, but it seems like the barn (err, garage) is awfully far from the house. Did you put it way out because you wanted it far away, or did the PsTB make you do it? "
"andre1969","October 2005"," Lemme guess? Powers That Be? They had some say in where I put the garage, but I decided from the get-go that I wanted it down that far in the yard. It's about 150 feet from the steps to my deck. But I kinda like it down there, because it's out of the way. It also makes the yard feel bigger, being down there kind of at the edge of the yard, although it's actually still about 50 feet from the property line on that side.The county made me put it 90 feet back from the road, though. Originally, I wanted to make it 60 feet back. I was under the impression you only had to be 25 feet back from the road, and 15 feet from your neighbors' property line. But then I found out that 25 feet is only for the main house. Any secondary detached buildings have to be at least 60 feet back. But to make matters worse, the county has it on their books that they want 30 feet of my land for a right-of-way to expand the road! :mad: They'll either get it over my dead body, but I'm really not that concerned about it...supposedly it's been on the books since the 70's, and most likely the only way the road would get widened would be if a developer came through and bought up me and all the neighbors tore it all down, and put up a development. And then I wouldn't care, because we'd all be paid off and gone! But anyway, they tacked that 30 feet onto the 60 foot requirement, making me put it back 90 feet. I ended up having to take down about 5 or 6 trees that were growing up at the edge of the woods, some of them leaning outward, and had to clear out a lot of brush. So, to make up for that, I'm going to let some of the yard out towards the road grow back up and plant some trees here and there...just not too close to the garage!And eventually, the house is either going to get moved or torn down and replaced, and when that time comes, the site I want to build on will be down closer to the garage. So that's another reason I put it that far down, so it wouldn't be practically up against the house when that time comes. "

I've had two Jeep Grand Cherokee Limiteds in the past ('96 and '99) so I was interested in the new Commander.

"nippononly","October 2005"," nope, your eyes do not deceive. Of all the domestic cars over the years, the Chryslers are generally the ones I have most liked the looks of.

Which are far from memorable. :-(As for the Supras, yes, the series you are thinking of ran from 1986 to 1992, although they were not my favorite series for styling. They were also the series when Toyota used a temperamental head gasket engendering many expensive repairs and an extended manufacturer warranty, as well as its first use of an adjustable suspension which was too soft in all settings and which is ENORMOUSLY expensive to replace as the car ages. My fave is the 82-85, chunky square style. The '84 I am looking at now has the 161 hp engine, 140K original miles, and a new paint job the owner has called ""polo green"" in his e-mail.

Also, they would have to evaluate the Focus to figure out what it's worth in trade.The dealer we were at last night called and offered the following deal:'06 Sonata GLS V6 (the 4-cyl we drove last night got sold) for $18,165 (after rebates) + TTL, plus they offered me $8500 for the Focus, sight unseen.I owe just over $8800 on the Focus, so this seems to be a great deal. Standard features on the Sonata GLS V6 include ABS, traction control, stability control, 6 airbags, power everything, keyless remote, fog lights and a whole bunch more.Then, as I was mulling these offers over, my daughter called from work and put everything into a tailspin. She wants to look further, perhaps at the Saturn ION, as it now comes with an AUX jack for her iPod standard. Her reasoning is that if she's going to drive this car for the next 3/5/7 years, she should make sure she gets what she really wants, and not just do a deal on the first car that we look at. So, we may go take a closer look at Saturns later today. Her mom simply rolled her eyes. "

"kyfdx","October 2005"," $22K for 3-year old MDX with high miles? I wouldn't... That is five years of payments at $420/month... I'd rather go lease a Honda Pilot or Ridgeline... They have killer deals, and at the end of three years you'll probably be out less cash, and certainly less for repairs and maintenance than for that used car...regards,kyfdx "
"anonymousposts","October 2005"," Honda's current lease deal on the Pilot is $289 per month + tax for a EX 2WD and $1500 down. MSRP of a EX 2WD is $29,000 while MSRP of the EX-L AWD with NAV is $35,000. Over 42 months you would have to add another $119 to equal the equipment of the MDX. Now you are up to $408 per month + tax. Pretty darn close to what the MDX will cost me. Difference is that I can sell the MDX at any time and probably not lose that much money. The same probably can't be said for a car I am leasing for 42 months. Also, the Pilot has the column shifter and the interior isn't quite as nice IMO. I'm also not thrilled with the 06 freshening of the Pilot. If we go through the credit union they will give me an extended warranty. If we don't use it they refund the entire cost. If we do use it then more than likely it has paid for itself. We could always buy the Odyssey at the end of the lease but it's missing a couple of things we want. Also, it was a great deal when we leased it and a so-so deal if we buy it at the end. In any event, it's all contingent on what they offer us for the Odyssey. "
"kyfdx","October 2005"," If you don't like the Pilot, I understand.... though, I think you could do better than the advertised lease deal... But, that Acura.. too many miles, plus have you seen the price of gas? :surprise: I think you'd have a harder time getting your money back out than you think, but I do agree about the increased flexibility of owning... I'm just not wild about $22K for a car that is that used. And, yes.. good lease deals usually make for poor purchases at lease end.. No disagreement there...regards,kyfdx "
"ghulet","October 2005"," I think sticker on a new Civic LX sedan with automatic is ~$17.3, and I think in the long run (the 5-7 years she will likely have the car), it will cost less in gas and depreciation than any Hyundai or Saturn, if history is any indication. Of course, the warranty on Hyundais is tempting, but that's about the best argument for buying one I can think of right now. "
"anonymousposts","October 2005"," but we have only put 16,000 miles on our Ody in close to 18 months. We might end up trading our Si too as part of this deal so we might put a few more miles on the MDX than we are on the Ody but it will not be our primary car. Gee will start driving his Lexus more and we will spend more time in the Accord. The MDX will be for trips and Home Depot/Walmart runs. I'll admit it's not a bargain basement price but at $22000 it's right at trade value and a few grand less than what we would typically pay at a dealer. It's also $19,000 off MSRP for a new one.We thought of it like this ... we were thinking about buying an Element which would've cost us around $20,000 + tax/accessories. For a bit more we are getting a nicer car with more options and close to the same MPG. It may have 55,000 miles but it's still an Acura so I have more faith in it than I would in a Mercedes or BMW that was out of warranty.Although if you think it's that bad of a deal you can always pay the difference and we'll buy a new one  "

"anonymousposts","October 2005"," My post was made in jest. I know there's no comparing the two cars and/or deals. The MDX is in beautiful shape. Similar MDX's at local no-haggle car dealerships are going for $25,000-$28,000. The MDX will not be used as a daily driver so we won't put more than 10,000-12,000 miles per year on it. When the Odyssey lease ends we will have to replace it with something that can haul us + stuff + my 3 nieces at times. The new Ody that I would want costs about $40,000.

"stickguy","October 2005"," for some reason, car makers seem to be going out of there way to keep the addicted from getting a fix. The latest offender is VW. Got all worked up about a killer lease offer on a Passat. But, after some poking around, the ""driver's wanted"" company decided that any driver that wants a moonroof also wants an auto tranny. Yup, they are following the Hyundai model (on the Sonata) and have decided that if you want to row your own gears, you must not like sun on your head.But, a friend has got me perculating about a Legacy. Turns out that you can get a very nicely equipped Legacy 2.5i SE for quite an attractive price, and it seems to be pretty loaded. And get this, it can be (theoretically) had with a 5 speed and a moonroof! Probably only going to retail for about 20K that way too. Lot's of car for loaded Mazda3 money.Now just have to go drive it to find out what the fatal flaw is (they all seem to have one..). I think lack of stereo controls on the steering wheel might be an issue, but I can accept that if it has great seats and drives nice.Can probably also sell the AWD to the wife as a safety feature, along with all the air bags, for our son who starts driving in 1.5 years. At least he already said he wants to learn on the stick (that's my boy!)I like the Legacy concept. A little smaller than the compitition, but still plenty of roomy for what I need, which is a little bigger than a sub compact (3/Civic/etc.), but less than a full boat barge. Kinda the mama bear car.A legacy is probably a good car to learn on. Easy to drive, manageable size, good visibility, and safe.

"michaellno","October 2005"," Oh man, oh man, oh man.Saturday was crazy. Test drove the ION ... daughter deemed it suitable for her needs.BUT....After further discussion, I think we decided (today, at least; check back tomorrow 'cuz we may have changed our mind) that the kid doesn't really need a car at college, for the following reasons:--> Everything she needs is on campus--> As a student, she is entitled to a free bus pass for the city bus system--> Mom and I can come visit when she gets homesick--> If she doesn't have a car, she won't need to work. We can send her the money we would be spending on a car payment directly to her for an ""allowance"".So, the plan is to sell the Focus outright next summer before she goes away (only about 80-90 miles from home - 2 hour drive) and then we'll become a two car family (VUE for wife and L300 for me).Should the kid decide she really wants a car, she can first get a job and we can get her something at that time .. this way, she is not obligated to work and can concentrate on her studies.I did, however, lay some groundwork with the wife regarding the acquisition of a Saturn SKY in a couple of years.

I am really tempted by it, but I have some of the same thoughts as Kydfx about the whole situation. We like the Odyssey, but a lease for 24 whole months is too confining. The Pilot lease is decent, but it is for 42 freakin' months. I would take on another 24 month lease, but I can't see one much longer than that. 36 months would be a stretch. My wife does have a little record going for buying a car every even year. When we met she had a new '94. Since then (see if you can follow me here) she bought a '96, '98, '00, '02, '04.

I sold my truck a few months back, rather than ante up for a new $600 set of tires. Thought I had ""DONE"" the truck thing. Now I miss my truck so much I am looking at picking up a newer one.

"marika","November 2005"," I don't belong here but I lurk out of a morbid fascination. I've been driving for 27 years but have purchased only one car in my life--the other two were gifts, one through a death in the family. Here are mine:-pre-1988, drove my parents' hand-me-downs-1988 honda accord dx coupe, crank windows et al., kept 13.5 years, gave to brother-in-law-1994 mb c280, gift from brother-in-law after death of sister, sold to pay off mtg-carless for 1.5 years, rode bike, bus, and walked-gifted with 1994 maxima with 175K miles on receiving, this is my current drive, and this car is so not me (power everything, leather everything, big, bulky, unwieldy, inefficient, vulgar, etc.) that it isn't funny. It gets horrible mpgs but it gets me around.I have never understood why people get so much pleasure out of owning so many different cars. I was always nervous about my financial future, in a way that greatly outweighed any desire to own a new car. In the late 90s I had a terrible hankering for a VW TDI but I didn't want car payments on top of mortgage payments and gradually the feeling passed.I guess you car junkies are fabulously well-to-do or something, because I would never have the nerve to actually buy car a year, or even once a decade! .It isn't that I don't like cars. I just like not having payments more.I probably will make my second purchase within a few years, however. I would like to have something that is somewhat in line with my values: extremely efficient, understated, and reliable. At the moment, I have only the third. "

"anonymousposts","November 2005"," If you consider the refund we will be getting from Honda for $330 for a payment we just made (payoff of $22,700 didn't include that payment) and you factor in the sales tax savings ($1250 or so) we really only had to come out of pocket $200 to get out of the Ody. Not bad considering we put no money down on the lease and still had 6 months left. The final total was $24,100 - $300 refund = $23,800. We were happy with $21000 for the Ody. Terry said high $20's-low $21's. He said we should trade for the Ody + $4000 or so. We ended up at $2800 including TTL.The MDX drives great. The dual front 8-way power seats means Gee can get more comfy when he isn't driving. The NAV is a fun toy and came in useful the first night when we were going a new way to my sister's house. We will take pictures soon and post them. Surprisingly clean vehicle for the mileage. We do spend a lot on cars but we also save more than we spend. I have 401k, stock, savings and Gee has savings and a ROTH. We also have quite a bit of home equity as a crutch should we need it. So while at the surface we may seem irresponsible we are far from it. I had the spider condo appraised by Carmax yesterday and they offered $5500. Gee is still torn over whether to sell it or keep it. And these are the days of our lives.... "

"michaellno","November 2005"," ...that I fall into the same category as jolie ... plenty happy with what we have at the moment (VUE, L300 and Focus).Currently, the plan is to sell the Focus outright next summer before kid goes off to college; that leaves the VUE for the wife and the L300 for me. Only 25 more payments on the L300 (geez, that sounds like a lot!), but I'm hoping to pay it off early as my child support obligations cease in about 18 months or so. Will be nice to have a bit of extra cash flow in our budget.What's funny is that by the time next summer rolls around, the Focus and the L will probably have the same amount of miles on them (45-50K). Wife asked if we'll break even on the Focus -- I'm pretty certain that we will, given that we owe about $8800 on it at the moment and the private party sale price, according to Edmunds, is about $9K. I imagine the numbers will only get better, as long as I don't put a huge number of miles onto the Focus (33K at the moment).Next step, however, is to get new shoes for the Focus ... the OEM Goodyears don't look like they are going to survive another Colorado winter.

I could not pass up the Dakota lease special (no payments for 24k miles) and originally intended to sell/trade the Supercrew. That would save a nice $564/mo for the 18 months we use the Dakota miles up, plus whatever equity I can get out of it (maybe $3k @ private sale) However, I'm now considering keeping rgw F-150 to drive once the Dakota goes bye-bye. The F-150 would be a 4yr old vehicle with 34k miles and $8k left to pay it off. It has a lot of equipment, so replacing it with a new 2007/2008 model would mean spending $5-7k more for an equivalent truck. I'd love to step up to a diesel 1-ton, but that's $15k more than I paid for my 03 F-150. And, the 3.99% rate I got @ my CU won't be beat for many years, maybe ever. When we move next year to a larger house for a growing family, the budget will get crunched for a couple years.To complicate the problem, keeping the F-150 would mean I drive it once Dakota (in which wife commutes now) goes. Wife works for DCX and can park closer if driving a DCX product, so she's done w/ non DCX commuters. I love driving the F-150, but 80miles/day @12mpg is costly. I volenteered to drive the minivan when we got it because my wife was a non-believer. We bought extra miles for that lease, but is easy to go over. I'd love to pay for F-150 fuel for a year, pay the truck off and either have no car payment with lots of fuel or keep it as a recreational vehicle (towing, yard/housework) and buy something more economical for the commute. Wife will most likely lease a minivan about the same time as Dakota goes to commute (she's giving in). Or, I could sell the F-150, keep my two lease vehicles and take the risk there will be something inexpensive to lease/buy in 18 months. I don't like having only lease vehicles with as many miles as I drive to work plus weekend family trips. FYI, wife only drives 30m/day.So, my requirement in 3 years and beyond is to have a minivan (prefer lease, not buy) and a truck. I prefer not to commute in a minivan (gimmie the fun manaul tranny car, please), and a truck is not economical. So, truck = 3rd vehicle and/or no payment primary commuter.So, do I sell the Supercrew now? "

"aaron_t","November 2005"," Yes, sorry for not being clear. I wrote a check for $2279 including taxes and plates for a year for a 2yr/24k mile lease on a 2005 Dakota SLT Quad Cab with only the V8/auto and tow package.. No further payments. So, < $100/mo OTD effectively. Yes, special circumstances for employees & family members only with lots of rebates ($1.5k employee bonus cash + $2k lease loyalty on top of employee price and regular Joe rebates). I figure we'll use the 24k miles up in about 18 months and turn it in. It's pre-paid, so I can turn it in as early as I want. $2280 for 24k miles, however long that takes to use up. The Stratus was a similar special for 1yr/12k miles. I'm still kicking myself for not buying that outright for $9500 after the lease. Not that it was a great car, but better than I was expecting and oh so cheap commuting transportation for many years.The Dakota is fine. The engine/tranny is nice for its weight. The back seat is larger than the Quad Cab Ram. Nice for the reverse facing child seat and not have mom kiss the dash in the front passenger seat. Bonus for the ride hight, about the same as the minivan for getting the kid bucked in. So far, 15mpg. Better than 12 F-150, but way fewer creature comforts. It's all relative.I liked the late 90's Civis Si, but not the last two. I'll get a fun car again some day. I'd love a Miata.

"jaserb","November 2005"," Lately I find myself jonesing after super cheap wheels. A few months ago I kept seeing a mid 90s Ford Escort 2dr at a ratty car lot with $1500 on the windshield. Looked really sharp. If I had any reason at all to switch I'd have jumped on it. Now that's gone, but the local Subie dealer has a '93 Sentra XE 2 door that they're trying to dump for $1950. 5 speed, A/C, Cruise, CD, 124k miles. I've always liked that style of Sentra - I had an SE-R a couple of years ago. The 2 door doesn't even have the motorized seat belts. It's cute and red, and it needs a home.Problem is I have 3 cars, all TIH. My old beater truck for bike hauling and yard work, the MPV for the family, and the Alfa Spider for sitting in the garage on jackstands while I tinker with it. The Sentra would be a phenomenal cheap-o commuter - I could probably drive it for 50k miles, get 35 MPG, and only need to replace maybe an alternator or a CV joint once in a while. But with a 5 mile one way commute I really can't justify a 4th car as a commuter, and it can't replace any of the other 3. The really weird part is that last week there was a layoff at my work, and part of me was hoping I wouldn't make it through so I could find a job with a longer commute and thus justify buying that Sentra. Sick, I know. Maybe I'm just going through CCB withdrawal - I haven't bought or sold a car since April! :surprise: -Jason "

I've thought about splurging and buying something really nice - a TSX or Legacy GT would fit the bill. I could easily afford either one, but I've discovered the perverse appeal of driving something at the bottom of its depreciation curve. I've put maybe $400 into my pickup in the last year for tires, DIY timing belts and tensioners, and a few other little things. That's barely a monthly payment for anything nice, with no guarantee the ""nice car"" wouldn't need more upkeep. And my truck will be worth $2k as long as it runs good and looks OK, so I might as well keep piling on the miles.-Jason "

"habitat1","November 2005"," So you want to get talked out of it?I had one as a loaner for several days last spring when my TL 6-speed was in for repairs (red-light runner took off my front bumper) When I went to return it, the dealer asked me what it would take for me to ""upgrade"" to the RL. I told him it wasn't an upgrade - and I meant it. My TL 6-speed is a lot more fun to drive. Noticably quicker, better handling IMO, much better braking (thanks to the 6-speed's Brembos). Not to mention a 6-speed gearbox that is as good as any sedan's. I'm not sure what techno do-dads or amenities that the 2006 RL has that the TL doesn't, other than the traffic based nav system. Which was very inaccurate in the DC area, I might add. We have the Bluetooth, voice activated Nav, DVD sound system, etc. But what is immediately apparant that the RL does have is an extra 600+ lbs of heft - without a noticably larger interior. If anyone says the RL is a fun to drive car, I have to question, as compared to what? A Buick maybe, a Lexus ES/LS maybe not, and a BMW 5-series, not in a million years. The new BMW 550i 6-speed is indeed an upgrade to the TL 6-speed. But the 4,000 lb Acura RL with a slushbox isn't, IMO. So, if you really must buy a new Acura, get a TL 6-speed and put the savings in your kid's college fund. There, is that what you needed? "

"michaellno","November 2005"," November marks the anniversary month for all three of my current vehicles.The L300 was purchased somewhere in mid-month, three years ago ... now has 43K on it and serves as my daughter's mobile locker. I try to keep the outside clean, but the inside will need a good detailing when she turns it back over to me next summer. Looks good (seeing has how it has lived outside for the past 18 months), runs strong, and the dent resistent panels come in handy in the high school parking lot.The Focus was purchased on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, two years ago. Now has 34K on it and serves as my daily driver. Just put new shoes on her last weekend (Falken Ziex) and we'll see how they do in the unpredictable weather here in Colorado. Other than that, she's done everything we've asked of her and returned ~30MPG in the process. Will probably get sold next summer when the daughter goes off to college.The VUE was purchased on the Saturday after Thanksgiving last year. Now has something like 14-15K on it ... wife loves it to death. Nothing that 250HP can't solve, though I am worried that the crappy Bridgestone OEM tires are going to wear out quickly. There have been lots of bad tales told on various Saturn forums about these tires; specifically, their tendency to aquaplane at the drop of a hat. I've told the wife that if that should start to happen, to let me know and we will put new tires on it immediately. The problem is that they are an odd size (235/65-17, I think) and there aren't too many choices for a direct size replacement. Other than the concern over the tires, there really hasn't been a problem with the VUE.Saturn service is as good as advertised, IMHO.I think I'm out of the market for the time being, though I will always be tempted to look and see what's available.PS. Son also bought his 2001 Saturn L200 on the same day we bought the VUE last November.

"habitat1","November 2005"," ""My wife has gotten passed being alarmed, and is now mostly amused.

Regarding the R350/500, a funny story. This past weekend I packed my wife and two daughters in our 911 S Cabriolet to go to Annapolis for lunch. As we were leaving the DC area, we pulled up to a light next to an R500. My 7 year old, very observant, exclaimed ""Look, a Mercedes mini-van"". To which my wife, a longstanding fan of the Mercedes wagon, added, ""boy that's not very attractive"". I shut them up before the driver rolled down his window, looked down at us and said, ""Wow, I didn't think you could fit a family of four in a 911"". He had his wife and one kid in the R500. They had the big sunroof(s), but I could see more than a bit of envy of our open air 911 on a nice sunny 65 degree November Saturday.So unless you are going to pack a lot of kids in that Mercedes ""mini-van"", may I offer an alternative that wouldn't cost a boatload more, but be a lot more fun to drive? The bonnet will hold a case or two of red wine and you can commute between your houses in record time. It might actually be fun enough that you can take a year or two reprieve form your affliction!

I don't drive nearly as much as I did, so wouldn't mind having a nicer car. *smacks back CCB thoughts* Nope, I'll be happy with what I have......*sigh*. "
"michaellno","November 2005"," I feel your pain.Was just about ready to pull the trigger on a deal for a Hyundai Sonata a few weeks ago, but a moment of clarity came over all of us and we decided not to do the deal.Shame, actually -- the Sonata is a very nice car. We didn't drive the V6 but the 4-cyl was peppy enough. Lots of room inside, nice standard features and a warranty that won't quit. Had two offers from two different dealers:$17,235 for a 4-cylinder GL and $18,195 for a V6 GLS. On top of that, the dealer with the V6 deal wanted to give us $8500 for the Focus.But, like I said, logic prevailed and we decided to put everything on hold. It's quite likely that the daughter won't need a car when she goes off to college next fall, so the Focus will get sold outright sometime next summer.However, the itch persists.albell: 1% of MSRP is what, $500? So you're talking about a $1000 difference (approximately) between the two offers. Could you go back to the upstate dealer with whom you have the deposit and tell them about the second offer? Perhaps they could match it?BTW, how far upstate are you talking about? My dad was born and raised in Peekskill. "
"andre1969","November 2005"," those prices are for the NEW Sonata?! Sounds like a lot of car for the money. "
"michaellno","November 2005"," Yep, both of these were the newly introduced 2006 MY Sonata. 162HP in the 4 banger, and 235HP in the V6. Heck, I was pretty tempted to trade in my L300 for one!Also, there was (and still is, I believe) $1500 in rebates on the 4-cyl and $2000 on the V6 ($1K straight rebate, $1K for financing with Hyundai). The prices offered included those rebates, so the 4-cyl was $150 over invoice and the V6 was offered right at invoice, according to the numbers I found at Edmunds.I didn't run the numbers for the LX V6 (top model trim w/ leather), but the only option I would have wanted was the sunroof - I suspect that I could get one for probably $21-22K after rebates, which isn't too bad of a deal since I paid $24K for my L300 3 years ago with 50 less horsepower. "
"albell","November 2005"," the difference in the present value of the deals is about $1200, plus downside protection on incentives. Upstate dealer is in Albany. Yes, I could go back to them, but then I feel like I am playing a game, which is not my intention. "
"michaellno","November 2005"," Not a game, but trying to find the best deal. Do you live in the greater NYC area? Is the closer dealer the same one you would be using to have your car serviced? I guess it's a matter of looking at the big picture. "
"albell","November 2005"," I live in NYC with a 2nd home upstate. Could be serviced at either, since the dealers would be pretty equidistant from my homes. Unless the vehicle is problematic, taking it out of the city for service is not that big an issue. Trying to not be dis-serviced in Manhattan any longer. "
"volvodan1","November 2005"," Legally you aren't bound to buy. They may renegotiate. How good is your word? You and the dealer agreed on a price. I would honor the agreement. "
"albell","November 2005"," Ouch. My word is usually at least as good as any car dealers'  . I didnt ask for a better deal, and I'm not being anything but upfront in any of my discussions with dealers. "
"woodyww","November 2005"," That's why they call it a ""refundable"" deposit. I'd also consider what kind of relationship, if any, you have with each dealership, their overall reputations, & any perks at either: loaner cars for service, etc. I'd say do one of 2 things: 1. get your deposit back, & place order with 2nd dealer, or 2. Tell dealer #1 your situation, & see if they'll match the other deal. Again, you have a ""refundable"" deposit.....go ahead & feel a bit guilty if you wish, & donate 10% of the savings to a good charity; they need it more than any M-B dealer. Just my 2 cents. *Should I feel remorse**the difference in the present value of the deals is about $1200, plus downside protection on incentives* "
"volvodan1","November 2005"," Every deposit is refundable. "
"albell","November 2005"," Normally, yes. but I have had dealers ask for a non-refundable deposit, which I have been asked for. They back down when you point out that a non-refundable deposit is not a normal course of business nor required under standard sales contracts. "
"chwood","November 2005"," I just moved from a 98 Civic to a Tundra. I drive by a Subaru dealer every chance I get so I can look for a WRX - new, used it does not matter. My four-yr old girl and wife often question what the heck I am thinking.I can't stop looking into when the toyota FJ cruiser will be available although I am in an 04 tundra doublecab and we just got my wife an 02 Honda Accord. I need to get a new car soon. I have a large drive way/garage, why not fill it up? Why do I have to live such a burden? Is there medication for this disease? "
"michaellno","November 2005"," It's only a burden if you can't afford to feed your addiction ... around here, you won't get much sympathy nor any recommendations for medication.We're all enablers, even those of us ""on the wagon"" - we vicariously live through others on this forum. "
"habitat1","November 2005"," ""Should I feel remorse?""The fact that you would even ask the question is evidence enough to me that you are an upstanding guy. There is no need to apologize for wanting to get a good deal. If I were you, I'd go back to the Albany dealer and explain that you were called and offered the $1,200 better deal. You'd prefer to do business with them, so they don't need to beat it, but you'd like them to match it.In both cases, this is an ""order"", so if the nearby dealership can live with a $500 over invoice deal, the Albany one should be able to. P.S. Since my 911 temptation fell flat, how about the Range Rover Sport? Probably not as utilitarian as the R350, but one of the best looking interiors I have seen in any SUV and damn nice performance, even in the non-supercharged model. Sorry, after buying a TL, MDX and 911 in the last 18 months, I have no intention of spending any more of my money. But it's fun to tempt others. "

"downhomeinga","November 2005"," Long time lurker - First time poster here!I seem to have fallen into the habit of buying my co-workers old cars - often in non-running condition.About 6 months ago bought a 91 Mazda 626 (I have a thing for older Mazda's - just one aspect of my sickness) loaded (but non-turbo) edition with a 5 speed. Kinda beaten up (kids) with 142K miles and numerous deferred maintenance issues. My co-worker had given up on it when the drivers window would no longer close. Then her husband shattered the window trying to force it closed. She parked it in her garage for 8 months until she decided to sell her house - then she had to get rid of it. Of course by then it did not run - so no one was interested in it.I bought it for $300, put a new battery in it and did a basic tune up and fluid change in her driveway. It started right up and I drove it home (50 miles) with no problems. Since then have probably put another $500 in it (and too much of my own time). Been using it as a parts getter and lifeboat.Kinda feel a little guilty about this transaction, but hey it's a 14 year old car that has been beaten on and still has a few issues after my fixes above.Thoughts on the guilt aspect of CCBA? Or the family/spouse related guilt? "
"downhomeinga","November 2005"," I apologize in advance for the long post - but I need therapy - and luckily I found CCBA!Then there is car #2 - purchased two weeks ago from another co-worker. A 1997 Maxima SE loaded with 162K miles in immaculate condition (dealer maintained since new). Co-worker overheated the car on the way home and had it towed in to a service station (that I had warned her did not sound reputable based on her prior experiences). They refill the radiator and do a pressure test - diagnosis blown head gasket due to the car continuing to overheat (but only at speed - not at idle). They want $3300 to install a used motor. I am advising her all along that this does not sound like a blown head to me, but a cooling flow issue. Advise her to get a second opinion at a radiator shop nearby.By this point she has full blown new car fever and has told the mechanic that she may be willing to sell the car as is. He offers her $600. I tell her that if she is going to go that route that I will double his offer to $1200. Again, advising her that I think she has a general cooling system problem - not a major engine issue. And further, that if I had some time with the car I could likely fix it for her for a few hundred in parts.She buys a new car, gives up on the Maxima and sells it to me for $1200. Before I buy it, I tell her I am concerned that she will be mad if I fix it cheaply/easily. She says she is not concerned.$300 (radiator, hoses, thermostat) and 2 hours later I have it back on the road.Feeling guilty, I tell her that I think I have it fixed and tell her what I did/what it cost.Her response? ""Good for you! Better you than some unscrupulous mechanic!""Still feeling kinda guilty driving such a nice car that I got from such a nice lady/friend for $1500.Should I feel guilty? Or is this just my overactive ""southern gentleman"" gene kicking in? "
"ghulet","November 2005"," You saved her $3300 on the new engine and $600 on the purchase, the car is nine years old and sounds like she wanted one anyway. You got a great deal, she's not angry (she would have no grounds to be anyway) and she has a new car. No harm, no foul. "
"nippononly","November 2005"," a situation where everyone wins! "
"akangl","November 2005"," I think the Dodge is trying to tell us something.......if I could only figure out what (maybe it wants to go back to the car lot??).We had a mechanic look at Kermit (our skidder) and the Dodge promptly started having starting issues. Mechanic fixed it for $20 (battery cable issue). Had Kermit hauled out of the woods yesterday and down to the mechanic. Now the Dodge doesn't want to put out any heat......can't figure out what's going on with it. Is this a sign?? Is the Dodge jealous of Kermit?? LOL, those two darn things keep us in the poor house. :sick: Hubby is talking about replacing the Dodge next year with an F-550. He's tired of the gas guzzling V10 and is paranoid with no warranty on a 7 year old truck.Unfortunatly the Dodge isn't worth anything to a dealer, at least that's what they are telling us. Most of them say they don't want it (from a couple months ago when we looked). What to do with a regular cab 1999 Ram 3500 V10 with 42k miles on it?? Kind of a strange duck me thinks.Argh.....just when I think we have the CCB habits licked! Least I'm happy with my 2.......3 more years and the Titan will be mine (after paying off the residual on the lease), Zippy should be paid off in that time as well. "
"anonymousposts","November 2005"," to fight off RL-itis. It was tough. We went up there with checkbook in hand but we couldn't come to terms in price. Besides, Gee wasn't too impressed with the light silver/tan interior RL that we took home overnight. They made one last ditch effort which might have worked. We still weren't positive we wanted it so we asked the salesman if we could take home the color combo we wanted overnight. He said sure so Gee drove up there only to find that the car that he went for was already sold. Good news is that the RL just came out so it will be available for years to come with better deals in the near future. He still needs to drive a manual IS250 as well. What surprised us is how well our 04 Accord compared to the 05 RL. Sure the RL is nicer and AWD but either the RL is overpriced or the Accord is one darn nice car for the price.Of course we still have the Lexus. We were going to sell it to Carmax for $5500 but decided that we could probably get more money for it by selling it private owner. It really is immaculate for the age and mileage. Terry in RWTIV said we could probably get $7500-$8000 selling it ourselves which would put $2000 more in our pocket. "
"qbrozen","November 2005"," I think its both. The Accord is an incredible deal for what you get (i found it compared favorably with much more expensive vehicles), AND i think the RL is a tad overpriced for what you get (then again, i don't find many new $50k cars to be worth the money). "
"qbrozen","November 2005"," no guilt necessary.Heck, I think she should be darned happy to get $1200 for a busted 160k mile ANYTHING. "
"anonymousposts","November 2005"," We had gotten them down to $41,000 and they were giving us $16,500 for the Accord EX-L 5-speed which has 27,000 miles now. It was an OK deal but not great. The only RL's they had in the color Gee wanted were demos so the $41,000 was still a bit high IMO. "
"qbrozen","November 2005"," Was it $41k for the demo or for the new one in the wrong color?'05 or '06? how many miles? "
"anonymousposts","November 2005"," Had they given us a price of $41,000 on a 0 mile RL we would've paid the $400 to have them trade with another dealer for the color Gee wanted. As it is, I was thinking $39,000 was fair. "

There are only two of us (no kids) and now there are five cars.Probably about time to trim the herd and sell off the mazda 626 I mentioned in post #4623.

"woodyww","November 2005"," That means it'd take 2 1/2 loaded 2 y.o. 6cyl. accords to trade for one demo RL.....seems like the Law of Diminishing Returns kicking in big time (to me).I'm starting to think, with the mix of cars you guys have now, all leaning towards the practical or luxury side, why not get a ""fun"" car? Used Z4? Used E46 bmw convertible? New Mini? etc. Something in the low $20's where you could also keep the Accord?

"downhomeinga","November 2005"," Yes, I have read of Andre's affliction. We have similar tastes in old Detroit iron. I still miss my 1978 Buick Regal (stolen and stripped many years ago).My fleet is not that impressive in specifics - just in total #. Here is the rundown:1) 1973 VW Squareback Type III - Current Status: non-running project car - I've had it about 10 years (8 of those it has been garaged waiting for me to swap the engine).2) 2002 PT Cruiser - Wife's daily driver - bought new - driven 30K miles a year - currently has about 110K miles & (knock on wood) no problems yet.3) 2001 Mazda B3000 Pickup - My former daily driver and now the home project hauler - leased new and lease is almost up (current mileage 50K).4) 1991 Mazda 626 - just a beater that i bought off a co-worker in non-running condition - using it as a parts getter and life when #2 or #3 are undergoing repairs. Current mileage 143K.5) 1997 Nissan Maxima SE - bought of a co-worker two weeks ago - 162K miles but in very good condition/well maintained. This one will likely become my daily driver once I am sure it is reliable.Now, what I need is a convertable. Maybe I can find a nice clean gen 1 Miata? Really like the looks of the new Solstice.But I am an accountant - and therefore cheap - & the thought of the first year depreciation would keep me up nights! "

The Honda is now the baby of the family at 135 miles. I still mourn the trade of our 1999 Volvo S80 T6, but it was time for that one to leave the nest. And, already, I am thinking ahead to the next ""new addition"", I mean car purchase . . .So glad to have found this forum for us and others like us. "
"andre1969","November 2005"," but I'm starting to get the urge again. And not the urge for another old mastodon, but for something newer. Right now I think the two new cars that intrigue me the most are the Charger (probably just a V-6, because I'm not in the mood to spend $30K plus for a car just yet) and the Ford Fusion, with a V-6. "
"qbrozen","November 2005"," I'm just curious ... any reason why you traded the Volvo and kept the Passat? "
"qbrozen","November 2005"," The Charger is supposedly a good deal of fun even with the V6 (latest autoweek). Have you driven both? I just think a FWD 220-hp V6 is outclassed by the competition these days. "

"downhomeinga","November 2005"," Will the fleet shrink when the truck goes back? This is the subject of much arguing right now with the boss lady.Again, Andre and my tastes are very similar - I am also tempted by the Charger V-6 and Fusion V-6. Might be getting a company paid car soon, and if I do it will likely be a Charger.If I don't get a company car - well then the arguments with the wife will get more fervent. Would like to find an older little convert - miata, etc - cheap.The roving eye is always looking for the next addition! "
"phylp","November 2005"," Excellent question. Glad to answer.The Volvo S80 was fast, comfortable, and safe, but there were some reliability issues -- especially with the emissions and the Chevrolet transmission. We traded the S80 for the Lexus RX330. So, we came away with ""comfortable, safe, and reliable"" but we lost ""fast."" That is why we kept the Passat -- to keep that quasi-sports car element: fast and smooth. There have been some mechanical issues with the Passat along the way, but nothing that affects the wonderful driving experience. "

"andre1969","November 2005"," I really think I'm daydreaming. I'm sure that once I actually start crunching some numbers on a Charger or Fusion (I think the type of Charger I want would only be around $22K or so, so it would be in range with the Fusion) I'd get cold feet.I'm just too cheap, I guess! It's funny though, that 6 years ago I had no trouble paying over $20K out the door for that Intrepid, but today, even though I'm making more, have more saved up, and so on, but I balk at throwing around that kind of money for another new car.It could also be that my needs have changed too, though. Back when I bought that Intrepid I had a part time job delivering pizzas, so it was very beneficial to have a reliable new car that got decent mileage. I also lived about 14 miles from my main job. Today though, I live 3 1/2 miles from work and only work the one job, so a reliable car that doesn't break down isn't quite as critical. I could walk to work if I had to. Plus, I've also seen the benefits of being able to save money, put it in 401ks and Roths and such, so now I've got my sights on early retirement. That may just be a pipe dream too, but I'd rather see my retirement date get moved up a few years than get the instant, but fleeting satisfaction of a new car now.Okay, I'll stop talking like that in the CCB forum, lest I get shot at! :shades: "
"phylp","November 2005"," Well, for one thing, the S80 was developed before the Ford acquisition. The story was that Volvo needed a transmission that would fit under the hood with such a big engine, and the GM tranny fit. When I was shopping for the car in 1999, the salesmen would claim that the S80 had the same GM transmission that was in the Cadillac . . . but, I think it was actually the same as the one in the Corsica. Not sure what is under the hood of the recent models.""Cars (and politics) make strange bedfellows."" "
"qbrozen","November 2005"," Yeah, when i was looking at S80s, i was told by many people to buy an '02 or newer. Transmission was the #1 reason. But I've also heard alot of bad things about VWs, hence my question. But, of course, you made the choice that fit your experience best. "

I just can't go for that on a whim.I started driving in 1985 and here is my list to the best of my recollection:1973 Dodge Charger1974 Olds Cutlass Salon1970 Chevy Chevelle (my first nice car - $3,700)1972 Buick LeSabre (first in a series of winter cars while the Chevelle was off the road)1971 Pontiac LeMans1973 Dodge Dart1976 Chevy Nova1978 Olds Cutlass Supreme1980 Dodge Aspen1981 Buick Regal1985 Buick Regal (got the engine from the 81 after an accident)1989 Camaro RS (5.0 but far too unreliable by 50k)1989 Honda Accord LXi (5 speed - driven to imports after too many GMs)1989 Honda Civic (my first new car bought on lease)2003 Nissan Altima 2.5S (I own this one and am driving automatics again)I just moved back to the burbs from Queens and am getting a 1993 Buick LeSabre for a second/station car. It feels good to be driving another 10 year old domestic s-box after all these years. As you can see, I've really slowed down as the purchase price of the cars has climbed. "
"andre1969","November 2005"," Sales tax must be killer in New York! I'd have to dig up the paperwork to be sure, but I think the sales tax on my Intrepid, which ended up being around $22,400 out the door, was around $1,000. I vaguely rmember the paperwork stating the sales price was $19,986, including freight but not including tax, title, registration, and the extended warranty, etc. We pay 5% tax, so I think it came out to around $1K. Not as bad as $1700-1800, but geeze, that's about the price I've paid for many of my cars! When you trade a car, don't they base the sales tax on the difference? For instance, if I pay $22K for a new Charger, and they give me $4K for my Intrepid, wouldn't I just pay the sales tax on the $18K difference, rather than the whole $22K?Another nice thing about an old beater is that you don't care as much when something happens to it. While my Intrepid isn't a beater yet, at least it's at the point where it's paid for, and I'm not going to fret over every little dent, ding, and stone chip like I would have when it was new. I still remember the first dent I put on the car (my fault) and I was PISSED!! And I don't want to have to deal with that all over again with my hypothetical new Charger or Fusion. "
"gsemike","November 2005"," I think that the tax rate here in NY is about 8.5%. It definately is high. In that above list, there have been many cars where the purchase price was less than the tax on the last car. If memory serves, I think I paid $50 or $100 for the Nova.If I traded my car in, I would just pay sales tax on the difference but with the lower value, I don't think that it's worth it. I looked at an Acura TSX not too seriously and they mentioned $9000 as a ballpark trade in. I think that the private retail would be around $12000 and dealer list my car as high as the 14s. Even though I'd save on the taxes, I don't think it's worth it.Regarding the Buick, having a second car is a luxury. It will be nice to have but I'm only 3/4 mile from the train. We got the car for free and it only cost about $300 to insure it. I figured that we'll take it 6 months at a time and as soon as it become more trouble than it's worth, it's gone. The car has about 115k with the tranny rebuilt at 90k. I hope to get a couple of years out of it.On a final note, the sales tax isn't the only tax that bring on the ouch-ful feeling. I'll rail about this on the Kiplinger message boards, but the property and income taxes are a burden as well. "

"andre1969","November 2005"," but I heard that the GM tranny used in BMWs was a unique one actually built to BMW specs, as opposed to being an existing domestic tranny that just got outsourced.GM has supplied automatic trannies to other makers for ages, probably because GM invented the automatic tranny and pretty much got it right from the get-go. They used to sell them to Lincoln, and I think Nashes used GM automatics for awhile, too. And in the 60's, Rolls Royce used GM automatics. "

"corvette","November 2005"," I would NOT pay nearly $40k for that vehicle which offers little more than an Impala at twice the price.It was one of those ""the devil I know"" things, plus it was one of those cars where the test drive was nice, but long-term ownership leaves something to be desired. She cross-shopped the old model TL, the G35, MDX, ES330 and old RX300. Of those, the TL, G35, and MDX (sorry, Anon and Gee) did not have very nice interiors. The new TL seems to have rectified that problem, but now has way too much horsepower for a FWD car. No one in our immediate family will ever own a VW/Audi/Porsche product again due to very bad past experiences, most of which are documented here on Edmunds. Mom likes BMWs, but she also hates computers, and I don't think the momentary-contact turn signal and wiper controls on the new models (or mandatory iDrive on the 5-series) would suit her at all, so, I don't know what she'll get next. When I drove the G35, I thought to myself that it would be the perfect car for her if it had a nicer interior. If she keeps the S80 past four years, it will most likely get the Volvo extended warranty. Compared to the Impala, the S80 is more refined in every way, but probably has less interior room. And, it has more snob appeal--if I were a member of a country club, I'd feel better about pulling up in it than an Impala (this is one of the reasons one of my friends is dying to buy a used 2001 Mercedes C-class with 90,000 miles). Dad is completely hopeless with the Beetle; he will just keep sinking money into it for the time being. It has new glowplugs and wires now. He may quit the job that requires such a long commute, which makes him reluctant to buy a new fuel miser car. "

"andre1969","November 2005"," but I prefer the Volvo to the Acura interior. I don't have a problem with either one, but I like the more linear, connected look of the Volvo. Like the way the little wood strip comes cleanly across, and how the shroud over the gauges carries over to the central HVAC ducts, or the nice, integrated sweep of the center console as it blends into the dash.Color might have something to do wtih it, too. I like the lighter eggshell/ecru/whatever you want to call it of the Volvo better than the light beige/brown of the Acura. "
"qbrozen","November 2005"," In addition to andre's comments (which i wholeheartedly agree with) also notice how the center console in the volvo is angled toward the driver.Everything seems to wrap around the driver, as opposed to the more minivan-like straight-up arrangement in the Acura. "

"mark156","November 2005"," Hi folks, I've been ""car looking"" for several weeks and will probably buy in early December. This is what I have been researching:2006 Land Rover LR3 HSE2006 Volvo XC90 V8 AWD2006 Volvo V70 wagon2006 Jeep Commander Limited (5.7 HEMI)2006 Cadillac SRX V82006 Mercedes R500So far, my conclusion is that the Land Rover has moved to the top where it was at the bottom a week ago. My requirements are that the vehicle must seat 6 or more people, have adequate power, AWD or 4x4 and have full sun visors that adjust once you move them to the side.Note: I have not driven any of these vehicles yet.My conclusion:*The Land Rover appears to have the most room inside, does not have adjustable sun visors but they are very large and it might work with a slight adjustment in the seat to keep the sun from hitting the side of your face. One complaint was that the dash looked very ""plasticy"" but Land Rover offers a wood kit for the dash that looked quite attractive. The third seat will fit a 6'2"" person comfortably.*All Volvo's have Non-Adjusting short sun visors. The headrests in the XC90 are not comfortable. (The plus)The third seats fold completely flat and I like the split flip gate and small tail gate configuration like the Land Rover.*The Volvo wagon's third seat is ONLY for small children so this one is not in the running.*The Jeep Commander was at the top of the list but now I don't care for the third seat set-up where the floor is raised 3 inches to accomodate the folding seats. Also, I don't care for the 'bolt screws' that are apparent all over the vehicle, on the dash, in the headlight assembly's and around the fender wheel-wells. I like to wash my vehicles myself and I keep thinking I'm going to have to keep a supply of Q-tips handy for cleaning the crevices. Also, for such a large vehicle, the second and third row are rather tight. The front passenger seat is only a 4-way power adjust (the bottom of the seat does not move up and down). For a $44,000 vehicle it should have 8-way power seats.* The Cadillac SRX is a nicely done vehicle. The sun visors don't fully adjust and are short. Third seat is a little small.*The Mercedes R500 is nice but too ""mini-vanish"" for me and it's $15,000 more than the Land Rover and will seat only 6 vs 7 for the LR3.These are basically visual and personal observations on how the vehicle will fit my needs. I know that the performance will vary some with each drivetrain/engine size. They all basically get the same fuel mileage which is about 14-15 in the city and 18-20 on the highway.Mark  "

"andre1969","November 2005"," I'm guessing that the price per square foot would actually go down as you go to larger buildings. For instance, a building that's double the square footage isn't going to take twice as much labor or twice as much total materials. You'd have twice as much roof and twice as much floor, but the wall area wouldn't increase all that much.Using my garage as an example, originally I spec'd a 30x40 gambrel barn with a full loft, and staircase going up to it. I was quoted $22,000, although the only site prep that included was drilling holes for the poles. Leveling, filling in, and the concrete slab was on my dime.Well, going to the smaller 24x40 building, and losing the second level, dropped the price to around $15,000. Which IMO is still pretty cheap, but that 30x40 foot gambrel barn really seemed like a deal for the money. I just wish the county hadn't put their foot down on it.  "

Independent of the lease deal.. I was trying to be realistic, but expecting the worst...but, it was actually a reasonable number.. I'm picking the car up Friday, and they told me their offer for my trade was good until then... I started making some calls when I left the dealership, and I think I've got it sold for $1200 more than their offer.. So, it was a very good day..Thanks for all of the congratulations.... hopefully, that will push the CCBA back into remission (yeah, right).regards,kyfdxHost-Prices Paid Forums(where I can now go back to, with my head held high...lol) "

"brightness04","November 2005"," Congrats on the great deal! Nowadays to get a car like that, one almost has to go through lease due to the lease-subsidies. For whatever reason, one just can't that much off MSRP through a purchase. A $500/mo lease payment should roughly translate into a $38k car not a $50k car; congrats on the deal. On the other hand, state excise tax often goes by MSRP; a $50k MSRP translates to over $1000 for the first year! and close to $700 for the second, and $400 for the third. That $500 or so extra tax bill over three years could have gone to BMW instead of the town tax collector if only BMW had put forward a more realistic MSRP to begin with. Good news for buyers at the tail end of a model year though: you are only liable for a fraction of the first year's monsterous tax bite. Double Congrats! "
"corvette","November 2005"," I'm hoping I can make it through Thanksgiving on summer tires, because the winters are still in my basement!  It may snow Tuesday, but I don't think it will be cold enough to stick. Right now, I have about 7500 miles. There are no major problems to report. Minor ones include a radio that won't turn on with the key out (it just flashes the screen for a second and shuts off). I would have gotten Comfort Access, were it available when my car was produced. It's everything I want in a daily driver, and I really enjoy driving it. The acceleration is good, the ride is firm but not jarring, and the handling is amazing. Keeping up with traffic in town entails shifting at around 2000 rpm, so I barely hear the engine. Are you already planning on replacing the 330Ci with an E92 in a couple of years?  "

"michaellno","November 2005"," 375K in 18 years? That's about 21K per year.I don't think I could figure out how many miles I've driven, given that I travelled about 2 weeks per month on business for approximately 15 years, mostly with rental cars. Now, on the vehicles that I owned personally ... hmmm, let's see:'79 Pontiac Sunbird - bought with 12K on it in the spring of '82; totalled in the summer of '85 with, I think, 65K = 53K'77 Olds Omega - kept for only a few months between the Sunbird and graduation - maybe 2K in that time'85 Honda Accord LX - bought with 16K, drove it until '88 and traded it in with 55K = 39K'86 Isusu P'up and '88 Isuzu Trooper - switched back and forth between these two during my first marriage. Both bought new. Sold both within 6 weeks of one another. P'up had, I think, 40K on it; Trooper had about the same. If I'm responsible for 1/2 the mileage on each, then that's 40K.'91 Nissan Sentra SE - bought new. Drove it for 2 1/2 years and 35K - moved to CO with this car.'93 Honda Accord DX - leased for 66 months (don't comment!) - spent most of its time in the airport parking lot. Turned in at end of lease with 58K on it.Then it gets tricky, as I have had many cars since the Accord where I was not the only driver.'98 Ford Expedition - leased new; traded in before lease end with 38K. I'll claim half of the miles (19K)'99 VW New Beetle - leased new; bought at end of lease. Traded in with 70K, but the last 15K were done by step son. Again, I'll take credit for half of the 55K (27K)'02 Ford Explorer - leased new; traded in before lease end with 33K - my half would be 17K'03 Saturn L300 - bought new; I put 39K on it in 2 years before it became my step-daughter's daily driver - now has 44K'03 Ford Focus - bought new; I started to use it as my daily driver with 12K on it. Now has 34K. So, 22K of it is mine.So, roughly 351K in 23 years - just over 15K per year.Again, if I add it all the rental car miles I drove, that would probably add on, hmmm ... Figure I travelled about 20 weeks per year for 15 years (350 weeks). Some weeks I would only put on a couple hundred miles; other weeks, I would drive several hundred miles to visit family and friends that were over and above the back and forth I would do. Figure an average of 400 miles per week. So, that's another 140K that I've driven.That puts me close to a half million miles (351K + 140K)Sheesh - that sounds like a lot when you total it all up.Should there be a Chronic Car Drivers Anonymous?

It has a medium blue interior with no tears and the headliner is like new which I think is unusual but that problem could have been straightened out by 93. Besides the front arm rest which flops all the way to the back seat, the interior is good but the ergonomics is not what I'm used to. It's got column shift and the HVAC is a series of small chrome buttons. It's got Dynaride whatever that is and the power antena still works.Hopefully it lasts until the Alt is paid for. "
"woodyww","November 2005"," Thinking of selling my 6 y.o. bmw 5-series wagon (Touring) with only 24K miles(!) & buying a used MDX, or used or new current-gen 4Runner.

Altho the CPO warranty has run out, & today the remote locks started acting flakey, altho it could be that both keys need new batteries(?). And in black, no SPP, the E-39 can look a bit boring IMO. Oh, & I'm sick of having to deal with snow tire changeovers on a RWD car; as usual my snows aren't on yet at Thanksgiving. (At least on AWD or FWD cars, even if snows are optimal, you can sort of get by without if need be).Problem is, the bmw might only be worth $18K now, even if I sold it privately. And I know no SUV will give me the same handling, or gas mileage, altho AWD & ground clearance would be a big plus in Mass. winters. And, just paying an extra $10K over what I could get for my car would be a fairly big deal for me, altho do-able.I've also considered mini-utes like the Forester or CRV, but I'm in a Toyota or Acura mood right now, & something more ""hunky"" would probably do it for me more.

"habitat1","November 2005"," I am so tempted in trading in my Jeep Wrangler, but for a change I want to buy a car with no upside down problem. Two ways I have avoided that my entire life. (1) Pay cash. (2) Stay away from Ford, GM and Chrysler.I see you have a Honda Pilot. My Honda S2000 was the best sub $75k car I've ever owned for driving enjoyment, fit and finish, zero problems and 3 year resale value. Consider it (or it's equivalent in 2008) before you throw money at a Mustang. Just a friendly suggestion. "
"anonymousposts","November 2005"," It depends on the car. I know when we first saw this MDX we did a lot of shopping and lower mileage versions were a $5000-$8000 premium for the same year with similar options. Sure we could've paid more and gotten one with 10,000-20,000 less miles but at the rate we drive we would've been out of warranty in less than a year anyways. We are fairly confident in Acura/Honda reliability although there are exceptions with any make/model you may choose. "
"woodyww","November 2005"," Yeah, saving $5000-$8000 means a lot. And I see your logic as you're buying a reliable make anyway. I've been ""on-line shopping"" for a current-gen 4Runner--the asking prices are just all over the map. You'd probably have to get one with 50K more miles than another to save $5K. Could be worth it with a Toyota? I dunno, I'm thinking, for myself, one with 10-20K miles, & even Certified, gotta love that 7 year (I think) CPO warranty. Not sure why I'm suddenly leaning to a 4Runner vs. an MDX--well, they're less expensive used, & maybe I want to more fully satisfy my ""truck gene"". *It depends on the car* "

"nippononly","November 2005"," I have one! For some reason, and in a major departure from my usual pattern, I managed 5 1/2 years and 115K miles in my '97 Sube Outback Sport, before the itch just got too strong. And I had more than one car the entire time I had it too, so it wasn't just because it was suddenly my only mode of transport. I have looked back over the years since, and more than once have wished I could have it back. It was a local buyer, and I still see her sometimes, years later. It is a lot dirtier now, but seems to be going just fine. So anyway, in a torrent (no pun intended) of dozens and dozens of vehicles over the years, I did manage to get over that 100K threshold exactly ONCE! :-Pgee: LOVE that pic of the Lexus!

Then again... 6 years old is 6 years old. Anyway ... would the car be that bad with a GOOD set of all-seasons that are rated very well in the snow? "
"woodyww","November 2005"," It's a 2000 528i wagon (Touring), auto, Premium, lthr, S/R, CD changer, 24K miles. A year ago Terry quoted me $19K as trade-in, & a few months ago I saw one similar to mine, super low miles, go for $19--something on e-bay. It does seem kind of ridiculous that such a nice low-mileage car should go for so little. It's probably such a good buy that I shouldn't sell it. Supposedly the E39 5-series are pretty reliable (esp. with the I-6), & IMO a lot more reliable than other current gen. German makes. (Knock wood) I have a new set of Dunlop WinterSport M3'sin the garage, just need to have them installed. The car is quite decent with good snows & the traction control; I had a set of Michelin snows that were pretty good but sold them to get the Dunlops.It might take $10K difference, roughly, if I sold the bmw privately, to get say an '04 MDX touring with low miles (& probably have to buy it privately to get a good price on one).Is it worth it? I dunno. The MDX has a 4 yr. warranty (I think), so I'd get maybe 2 yrs. warranty with an '04. I could also try to rationalize it with the resale value of Acuras, the AWD, the extra ground clearance & visibility with an SUV.Then again, I know I'm just jones-ing for a new automotive ""fix"". And I'm partly just bored with the way the E39 wagons look in black, & sick of black cars in general. If you want a 530i stick, make sure to get one with the Sport Package--mine doesn't have it, & that's always bugged me. And try to get one with Xenons--it costs a ton to retro-fit them......cheers, woody "

Too bad I will likely be getting a killer offer on the incoming unit I have my name attached to...But, as often proven, it's not a good idea for me to buy anything because it is cheap, or that I have to rationalize my way into.

The only thing that saved me on the Passat was that I bought a slightly used one & saved $6000, so I lost almost nothing when I traded it in.Heck, I'd buy a used BMW 3-series in a heartbeat, before a new VW. If you want great seats, handling, etc. it's the ""real deal"". Just my 2 cents. "

I actually have taken my Scion back more times than any other new car I ever had, except for out 1996 Voyager.My problems usually come when I settle for less than I want, so I get the urge too soon.I also have had good luck with other ""problematic"" cars. I had a '95 Mystique (bought in '98, kept 3 years) that gave me no trouble, other than a spark plug wire that went bad.I could lease, or, if it turns out to be a dog, take the bath and move it.It is a very nice comfy car though. And I would certainly accept a few foibles to have a car I loved driving, instead of hating every minute driving a boring appliance like a Camry (no offense intended to the happy Camry owner!)The reviews on the 2.0T model seem to give it glowing praise at least.

After dealing with every VW dealer in Kentucky except one, and having had two late-model VWs in my family, I have some beefs about their mechanical quality and dealer sales and service practices. It's too soon to have any meaningful information on the reliability of the fifth-generation Jetta--we'll have a better idea in a couple of years. The new Jettas are not selling well, so you may be able to drive a hard bargain on one. "

Or could you save a lot by buying a 1-2 y.o. one?

"stickguy","December 2005"," we at least have some good dealers here. Plus I get to look at the Porsches while I am there.The 2.0T as I would get it is just about 26K even MSRP, and 24K invoice, so I would expect to pay the 24 or less. So, at least a few grand below a TSX, and much less than a 3 series or a TL. An A3 would be 30K with my minimum requirements.so, getting into the 23-24K range is a tough area to decide. Not real expensive (3 series, IS 250), but not real cheap (Civic, Mazda 3). But, a lot of car and features for the $$, if you overlook the VW badge.I won't get a 30K+ car past the boss (or the moths in my wallet), and I can't really find anything that floats the boat in the high teens/low 20s (the Legacy was the best bet there). A TSX is an idea. Maybe should try one again, but the 2.0T is a sweet engine. Lower cruising RPM, and a boat load of torque. No need to rev the dickens out of it like on the TSX.The Jetta would probably be +/- 3 K less initially too. Besides, lousy resale is another reason to hang onto it, and I can (and have) keep a car for 6+ years if I like it. The key is to get one I like to start with. And this one really will have to last me through the first college run (7 years at this point) ends, unless my son does me a favor and gets a good scholorship.That, and if I buy another one now, my wife will hit me with a cast iron skillet if I even mention looking at another car!Once I drive the Jetta I will have a better idea of what to do.

What's that?--$4K a year roughly.BTW--(you own a new 3 Series, is that right?)--I picked up my 6 y.o. 5-series today from the mechanic--cost me $218 to fix the central locking problem. (How many cars would cost less than that to fix a similar problem)? I was telling the owner I was thinking of selling the car. He looked at the mileage (24K miles), & said to keep it, unless I got some unbelieveable offer for it. I think he's right--I probably wouldn't get enough extra for the low miles to make it worth it to sell, if that makes sense.I just have this terrible urge right now to buy another vehicle, & if I bought one that cost $25-$30K, I'd have to sell the E39. I could pay $10K for a car & keep mine--I wonder what a really nice, restored 2002 would cost? Or.......? "

Seven were for routine maintenance. 22 were for repairs or to purchase parts so I could do the repairs myself. And that's not counting the parts I ordered online or jobs I did at home. "

And I determined to stick with one year-around-car after that.The only way I'd sell the 5-series at this point is if I got such a killer deal on a mint low-mileage MDX that I couldn't pass it up.

If they had something comparable on a 2.0T(say $299/mo), that would be tempting.Actually, one reason to lease is that I will be teaching my son to drive a stick on this car.

If they throw out a number I can't resist, I'll do it.I do seem to have cooled on the Legacy though.

If you trade it in the dealer can deduct what the tax would be for you to buy it thus making their payoff lower than what you would pay. If you think of it in terms of sales tax it actually benefits you to lease it. Depending on what the sales tax is in your state it could save you $1000+ on a $20,000 car. Since your car is paid for the dealer would have to cut you a check back for the value of the tC. If you do decide to lease it may pay to sell the car on your own or shop it around at local dealers (maybe Carmax if you have one close to you) and get the most money possible. Considering the popularity of the car and the low miles on yours it might be most beneficial to sell it private owner to a parent buying their child a Christmas present. "

"anonymousposts","December 2005"," while we were waiting for them to return the Si to stock form and Gee wasn't impressed. We've explored most of our options and there isn't a car out there that matches 100% to what he wants right now. The IS250 was OK but the stick felt sloppy compared to our Accord and Gee hated the dash without the NAV. With the NAV the price is $35,000 but he still won't like the way the car shifts. He does not like the G35's interior even after the refresh. He doesn't want FWD so that rules out the TSX and the TL. At the end of the day we decided that the Accord is the best way to go. It drives great, has been reliable, has XM radio, and has one of the best manual trannys on the market. So.... we are in the process of buying out the Accord lease and we will drive both it and the MDX until 100,000 miles. We will add some wheels to it, go to Florida and get the windows tinted, and maybe drop it a bit depending on how it looks with the wheels. In the meantime, we will still jump on any outstanding deals that come along. "

"anonymousposts","December 2005"," We looked at it this way. The residual on the Accord is $13,800 X 5% sales tax had we bought it out at the end of the lease. That's $14,400. Financed for 2 years @ 3.4% that's $14,904 + $6480 in remaining lease payments. That's $21,384. Honda does not negotiate lease residuals so we would pay the $13800 at the end regardless.If we buy out the Accord right now the payoff is $19,700. Financed for 48 months @ 5% we will end up paying $21,744. Not that much of a difference. Might as well buy it now and stop worrying about the mileage. We will pay it off before 48 months so the totals will be even closer. Also, in 18 months our payoff will be $12,800 vs. a $13,800 residual + tax if we continue the lease. "

(Personally, I think an E46 3-series, or current-gen 3-series, might ""do it"" for you & Gee based on my reading of your posts. Some people think none of the competing Japanese cars really = it overall).Whoops, I meant to just say what a good idea keeping your Accord sounds like......my brain has bmw (& other expensive Euro. cars) lust.....(they should have a pill out to cure that by now).

This, mind you, is for an '04 V70 2.5T with 26,000 miles and an asking price of $26K.Volvo dealer has since raised their bid for the Denali to $31K. Sis still says no, and thinks she can sell it for $35K privately.I took a quick look at Edmunds TMV ... if she can get $31K in trade, she should take it and run, as that's the private party selling value.

"michaellno","December 2005"," I agree with you ... since my sister works at home (in home child care) and all her amenities are so close, I understand your financial argument.I totally forgot about the new GM full-sized SUVs being released next year and the effect it will have on the current generation values - another valid point.What I find funny (in a sad sort of way) is that she really didn't want the Denali in the first place. She had a perfectly serviceable Odyssey; I suspect that my BIL, being the ""image"" kind of guy that he is, didn't like driving a minivan (he also traded out of a G35 lease for a lease on a 530i).Now they are stuck with a $750/mo note for the Denali, the 12-13 MPG that they get.Here's my sister's logic (I think):Current Denali payment: $750new payment (she hopes): $400-500Monthly savings: $250-350Gas (per month) - sis says she only fills up every other week @ $55 per tank: $110Not sure what V70 gets for gas mileage, but she may be able to get away with 1 1/2 tanks of gas per month, and we'll estimate $35 per tank: $50-55Monthly savings: $55-60So, she would be saving approximately $300-400 per month. If, and it's a big if, she can get, let's say, $32K for the Denali ($4K upside down), she's looking at 10-13 months to make up the difference.Or is my math all wrong?Don't know about insurance costs.

"woodyww","December 2005"," I'm not smart enough to figure out these deals where the owner is upside down on their current vehicle, & to boot is financing the new one. And I don't base my opinion to sell the Denali just on the fuel cost--more on how that may affect the resale value later on--& what if gas prices go up more? I don't see a downside to this--if--she's getting a great price for the SUV, & not getting ripped on the Volvo or the financing for it. And whether or not someone is ""upside down"", I'm not sure that means they shouldn't sell the vehicle--that's a ""sunk cost"", right? i.e., they're upside down even if they keep it. (They've already lost that amount, whatever they do, right)?  And paying $55 to fill up, you better really like the vehicle, or it does get depressing......whatever the logic. You could also ask Terry on the RWTIV board--I'm sure he could analyze the whole situation if you provided all the info.....And FWIW, I can't even imagine a $750 car payment. "
"corvette","December 2005"," I remember when the full-size GM trucks got a more user-friendly interior back in 1995, a fully loaded 4x4 Suburban with leather seats was around $36,000. At that price, it cost little more than an entry level luxury car. Now, if you add a sunroof and nav system, a Yukon XL is around $50k, the Denali is $56k, and the Escalade is $64-ish. Any of those is a good bit more than an entry-level luxury car. I think the full-size GM trucks are better bought used. One question remains: Is GM mad? $64k is M-class money, and that even includes the AMG sport package and Keyless Go. You could also have a Cayenne. Also, the Japanese offerings have the same features but much lower sticker prices. It's no wonder GM has to offer so many incentives to move these things. "

"hammen2","December 2005"," The new Escalade was designed with input from athletes and rap stars.

That's the sole reason why they're considering selling it - if GMAC can't offer competitive finance rates, it will affect how GM can move the metal...But, this isn't the proper place to discuss GM's future...

Given the terrible depreciation of the American models and the general air of long-term unreliability of the German models, those might be better as leases. In fact, I can't think of any German model I would buy, given all the long-term problems they have. I would be sure to lease if I picked one of those up. Of course, the very best VW can do for leases right now still isn't that great. A Jetta VE for $250/month plus tax, and I still have to give them $1000 or more to drive the car away?

Some of the prices would make it tempting to just make the remaining payments and turn it in in 15/18 months when you hit the mileage limit. Subaru's leases always seem to be a good deal on the base models, but only fair--and nothing more--on the loaded models. When I had my snow tires put on a few days ago, the indpendent BMW mechanic was saying that the spark plugs on BMWs only last around 80,000 miles compared to the 100k that BMW claims. My only response was that I had a long ways to go, but I thought to myself I'll be lucky to keep a car that long! "

"kyfdx","December 2005"," Yeah... technically, this might work... If the low money factor is the only incentive on the car... and the residual is realistic...But... you have that acquistion fee ($625 on a BMW) that you don't have on a purchase... And, depending on your state tax laws, you may end up paying more in sales tax over the long term that way.. It could work for someone that is fiscally responsible, and can stick with the plan... that isn't very many of us.... Plus, when that lease is up, and you can lease another new car for the same amount as the 48 month payment on the car you are buying out of the lease....  Well..

"michaellno","December 2005"," Wow, that seems like a really good deal! We were paying $490/mo on a 3 year lease on our '99 Expedition, which had an MSRP of something like $32-33K, so to have the same payemnt on a car worth another 10 grand seems cheap.In Colorado, you pay for the registration separate .. it doesn't get handled by the dealer, but is a percentage of the value of the car (2.1% in year 1, 1.8% in year 2, etc.).Which means that you're looking at $1100 initially (first pmt + $625 acquisition fee), then another $800-900 for the tags. The first time we licensed the Expedition, it cost something like $700! And, since we had also leased a VW New Beetle at about the same time, the check we wrote to the DMV was over $1000!Now that we're buying our cars, the annual renewal keeps decreasing each year .. I'm hoping to spend something like $600 for all 3 of our cars this year. As if that wasn't bad enough, since we were foolish enough to buy all of our cars in November, the renewal is due in January of each year, so I've got to have that money ready to go right after the holidays!

Both V-6, rust-free, paint is glossy, it's pretty amazing given the age. I looked for the telltale signs of a repaint, and couldn't find any. They have an '88 for $2500 and a '91 for $4000.

"woodyww","December 2005"," GOOD point. I'm biased towards owning high end German cars, & the only way I can sanely do that is to buy them used with a few miles & years on them. And probably paying cash is part of the equation, to avoid financing charges on a used car.So the discussion of leasing a New 525i at $500/mo. got me thinking about what buying my then 2 y.o. 5 series has really cost me. A lot less than buying or leasing a new one. And, & don't have to fool around now leasing another car, with more payments.Another way I'm looking at it is, the kind of new cars I could have leased at the time for around $300/mo. were IMO not remotely in the same league at all as a bmw 5-series.Of course, I had to cough up $34K upfront, which a lot of people can't or don't want to do (I'm not sure I would at this point).I'm also usually a ""keep a car for 10 years"" kind of guy (if I really like the car). So it would be interesting to compare what that costs over 10 years rather than going thru 3 or 4 leases during that time. So I'm hoping that by keeping the car another few years I can really make the initial purchase ""pay off"". Of course all of this is based on my personal preferances. It ""feels like"" I'm being more frugal to pay cash for a really nice 2 y.o. car., & keep it for 8-10 years. And I can thus ""rationalize"" owning a really nice BMW. And of course, a truly sick bmw nut sometimes needs to rationalize like crazy.Gotta go, & think up some reasons why it ""makes sense"" for me to buy an M3.......cheers, woody "
"woodyww","December 2005"," Here's a big, giant vote for the TSX over the VW. You will thank yourself in a few years, & probably immediately as well. To me, Acura = ""Quality"". And you will get the extra $2.5K versus the VW back when you sell it someday (& probably more than that, compared to a VW of the same year).And if I get the sense of your post, it seems like you ""want"" the Acura more than the VW, or Subie.....

"anonymousposts","December 2005"," fits all of your criteria + the bonus is that it is an Acura which will probably net you better service as well as less of that better service.The TSX has the 6-speed, safety, reliability, great seats, and every other doo-dad is standard (except NAV). Plus, it's got the turn signals in the mirror. FWIW: Our dealership just offered $14,000 on a 05 TC with 15,000 miles. Maybe there is more money to be had on your trade. Have you tried shopping it around at a Scion dealer? If they don't have a lot of inventory they might give you good money to sell it back. "
"stickguy","December 2005"," I think carmax would offer more.The Sube dealer called Saturday and came up to 13K on it. I told them I wanted 14K, and if they had taken it I would probably have the Legacy already.I did stop at the Scion dealer I bought it from and chatted with the salesdude. I did say I might trade it. They came back (sight unseen) with 13K, which was ""book"". But, per Terry's nice little list, it seems they are going well above book at this point.Oh, and they had another 2005 on used row (an AT, silimilar miles), asking $19,995. A different local dealer has a 5 speed '05 listed at $19,995 also. Mine is just about front row ready. DOesn't even need to be waxed, since I just did it!Actually, the Sube is a nice car, and has a lot going for it.

THe real comparison should be to an Accord EX-L, which has almost all the good stuff, or at least enough to make a 5K price difference hard to justify, but I'm sure I will manage somehow.I will have it for 10 years if I get something nice, so I better like it!

Still brand new (only 11 miles on it, and I put on 1/2 of them on an earlier test drive). It was also built in 8/05, so it's just about as real-time new as an '06.It be silver with black guts. Drives amazingly nice, and worlds ahead of the tC in comfort, refinement, etc. Also much longer, which I have to remember when pulling into the garage, but not much (if at all) wider.I finally decided (courtesy of the TSX) that I really ""needed"" heated leather thrones. And I finally came to the conclusion that not getting built-in XM was going to lead to a serious case of buyers remorse.The Legacy was actually very nice, and a tidier (TSX ish) size, but the Honda is a whole bunch roomier and more comfortable, so the family (especially the wife) will appreciate it.And did I mention XM?FUnny thing is, after seeing them side by side, I realized that the car looks better with the old butt. It just matches better, and looks OK in silver. I may spring for a spoiler some day, which really changes the look of the back end.SO far, up to 25 miles, and still happy! Might be a new record.

Best guess, at least 2K less than an '06 would have cost me, maybe more like 2.5K, so enough to make it worth my while. Plus, the wife signed off on the deal (I think she was happy I wasn't getting the Sube, since she saw some problems in the future with that one).

That 4 banger is essentially the same one that's in the Mazda3, so it's a nice motor and probably has the best MPG of any truck out there.ps. Sent you an e-mail-Jason "
"nippononly","December 2005"," they were trying to capitalize on the fact that the truck had not yet reached 10K miles, by asking a price that was more than it probably cost new. It's a 4-cyl 2WD with the steel wheels, for goodness' sake. Shame on them for putting such a high price on it. I wouldn't pay a dime over $14K for that one. OK, the Lexus dealer near me has THE MOST PRISTINE '91 ES250 I have ever seen. It has only 74K miles and looks like it has been parked in a garage all its life. Leather seats and moonroof, automatic, everything I never knew I wanted and always thought I didn't want, so why do I find myself irresistibly drawn to it? It actually looks cute to me. :confuse: Asking price is $5K, I figure he would go a few hundred lower and price seems to be spot on. It has brand new tires and brakes, and it is truly immaculate. Why on Earth am I thinking about going for a second drive here????I haven't been a one-car guy for many many years now, I should have known that trying to limit myself to just one vehicle was going to be my undoing.

"guss","December 2005"," Congratulations on the new Accord. The rear end was a deal breaker for me the last time I was looking. I could not wait for them to change it. I would have got the coupe just to not have the sedan rear. I think the sedan must have grown on me though because I think it is nicer than the new version. With the spoiler it actually looks good. The one thing I miss now that winter is hear is my heated seats. I rarely used to wear a coat in the winter, I loved that heat message.  "
"gee35coupe","December 2005"," Get the front and rear lip spoilers. You'll love em. If nothing else, they make your Accord different than all the others. Especially the front one since no one really knows about it. It visually lowers the front end at little.And you are right about the XM. There is no substitute. Cept maybe an IPOD hookup and hundreds of CD's. That's the only thing I miss in my LS.Speaking of the LS...I got a major service done at the dealer for Christmas. The first one since I bought it. $1000 down. I need a few bushings and rear brakes. I'll do em later but that's another grand. Not to mention the timing belt service coming up in a while. Hmmm...Carmax offered $5500. If I could find something else that I liked as much..... "

"michaellno","December 2005"," The dealer he's been working with found him another truck to look at ....2002 Chevy S-10, ext cab, V6, auto, power evreything, but 50K miles. They are asking $12K.Talked with the kid for about an hour regarding his options. The Toyota has a TMV of around $17K, so the asking price seems to be in line with that. Asked him what he would rather be driving in 5 years, assuming 12K miles per year:-> the Toyota with 60-70K on it, or-> the Chevy with 110K on itGiven that the Toyota will probably last 150K easily, he would have another 5-7 years of life left on the Toyota after he pays it off.We also talked about a new truck. The '06 Tacoma ext cab (4-cyl stick 2wd) invoices for under $16K - add some power goodies for another $1200 and you've got a pretty good deal for about what they are asking for the used truck.Of course, finding something like that would probably be impossible, unless he decided to try looking in Las Vegas.Hmm, now that I'm thinking about it, he might be able to get into a base Silverado for not much money. I seem to remember Andre talking about it over the summer when the employee pricing deal was going on. "
"stickguy","December 2005"," looks better for '05 with the all red taillights. Funny how a minor tweak makes a big difference.Actually, the new rear looks OK by itself, but when you see them side by side, the old rear does match the car better. The new one looks tagged on, and makes the back end kinds boxy.The 6 speed V6 was a thought (along with the TSX), but for the driving I do, the 4 cyl stick is plenty fast enough. No need to put my license any more at risk than it already is. This package is deceptively quick anyway, so it's not like I'm driving a rolling roadblockAmazingly quiet too. With the XM cranked up, you can hardly hear anything else. Much more comfortable than the tC, and easier to get in/out of. The black leather interior looks very upscale too.THe price difference was a mojor factor too. Yeah, the TSX was nice, and the V6 would be faster, but the really didn't offer much more that I would benefit from, at least not 6-7K worth.And lastly, in 1.5 years my son learns to drive, so no need for something too fast for that!And don't tell the wife, but by getting the cheaper car, I can now look for a toy again (err., something to work on for my sone, yeah, that's the ticket!) "
"nippononly","December 2005"," Yeah, I WAS looking for a manual shift, and I am not usually a fan of leather either. But I am such a sucker for old cars that have been really well taken care of. This car has styling and an interior from a different era, which I think was a better era. Not to mention it was one of the two models that launched Lexus.OK, I promise not to get misty-eyed...:-PYou are correct, no motorized belts and it does have a driver's airbag. It also has ABS and does NOT have the electroluminescent gauges that have failed so expensively in some LS400s of that era. michaell: it is absolutely true that you can get a 2WD regular cab 1/2-ton Silverado for $15,8 right now with Red Tag pricing. I just saw the ad on TV. It will GUZZLE gas next to the Tacoma, probably doubling runnning costs. But I would not pay almost $17K for the Tacoma either, and you are quite right that for $17K you could get into a brand new '06 Tacoma 2WD with the base package of options (convenience package, or something like that?). You would still have A/C and a CD radio, not to mention the plastic non-rusting bed, for the same money. I say it again, I wouldn't pay a penny over $14K for the '04 Tacoma. OK, maybe $14,5 if it is really that nice. "

They also have a white super cab with the 3.0L V6 and a stick for $16.5K.

"stickguy","December 2005"," took the wife out for a ride at lunch. She actually seems to really like it (even said it was a nice car). Of course, I don't think she ever really cared for the Scion. Not that comfy for her. The Honda has Lot's more room and easier to get in and out of.Also a much better cruiser on the highway. Very relaxed at 70, instead of buzzing along at 3,200 RPM.Pretty impressive, I have had it for almost a full day, and haven't stopped to look at replacements yet! "
"andre1969","December 2005"," I think I spec'ed out a GMC Sierra (I prefer their style to the Silverado) the way I would've wanted it, regular cab, long bed, with a 4.8 V-8, automatic, sliding rear window, CD player, and limited slip for under $17K. Going with the 4.3 V-6, which would still be a better performer than the 305 in my '85 Silverado, got it to under $16K. I was really tempted at the time, but instead just sunk another $1100 into my '85 to keep it running. Plus, it would've been almost impossible to find just that truck. I searched dealer inventories and most of their trucks were pretty loaded up. Plus, the regular cab/8-foot bed style is something of a rarity these days.Just for kicks, I went to the Chevy website and spec'd a Silverado. Came out to a red tag price of $16,866.65. Pretty tempting, but I doubt I'd be able to find just the truck I wanted. Of course, I'd be willing to take one more optioned up, for the same price!  "
"guss","December 2005"," The way you originally specked it out is the way every plumber/electrician/carpenter would order it, in white of course.We order a couple a year sans the cd player.

"woodyww","December 2005"," At the prices you guys are talking about, I'd probably just buy new. And usually I'd go for a Toyota over a Chevy, but at what, $15.8K? for a new full size chevy p/u, it makes you think. I would not buy a 2002 Chevy S-10 w/50K miles for $12K, no matter what.....Of course, the Toyota should last forever. With the chevy, I'd consider what the dealer is like where you buy it/get it serviced. And the Toyota might be a ""hipper ride"" for your son (?)My own experience with 1 chevy p/u, & 1 Toyota, was like night & day (guess which)? At that time tho, a full size GM p/u was about twice the size of the little toyotas in the mid-80s, so presumably much safer. So I'd consider safety too, if there's any data on current models. "
"andre1969","December 2005"," I guess one of the things I was getting nitpicky about was a sliding rear window, which seems to be a rarity these days. I guess I could always have one put in though, on a truck with a solid rear window. And the only limited-slip rear-end I've ever owned is currently sitting in a plastic bin packed away somewhere in my Grandma's garage, awaiting installation into my '68 Dart. Of course, it's been awaiting installation for about 7 years now!  So I really don't know what I'm missing there.So maybe I will think about a new truck the next time something major comes up with this one.Oh, and on the subject of Chevy S-10's, I hear the 4.3 in them is a horrible guzzler. Although for some reason it's NOT that bad in the full-sized trucks, so I wonder why it would get such a bad rap in the small ones? :confuse: "
"michaellno","December 2005"," Nah, I don't think he's looking for a 'hipper ride'. He's starting to work as a plumber's apprentice and needs the truck for the tools he will be acquiring.He's looking for a truck much like andre spec'd out - AC, CD player, stick shift, crank windows.I'm pretty sure he is going to stay away from the '02 S-10. It's possible that he will check out the Ranger or he might end up buying the used Toyota.I told him to call me tonight after he gets off work so we can discuss further. "
"jaserb","December 2005"," I've had some experience with the Ford and GM little trucks. I've owned 2 S10s, never owned a Ranger but I've looked at a bunch. The s10 got decontented in 1998 and it really shows - I had a '97 with over 100k miles, then a '98 with under 40k. The '97's interior was in far better shape than the '98, even with many more miles. The 4.3 V6 is pretty torquey but very thirsty. I've never had a 4 banger.The Rangers / Mazdas come with 3 motors, the 2.3, 3.0, or 4.0. The 2.3 and 4.0 are good motors, but the 3.0 is better used as a boat anchor. It's the old Vulcan v6 that's been in Taurii since the '80s. It barely has the power of the 4 cyl (I think it's like 4 more hp) but sucks gas just like the 4.0. The worst of both worlds. I still think the truck I mentioned earlier is the best deal going in a small truck - the Mazda B2300 SE Cab Plus. They came pretty loaded - A/C and CD were standard, I think. They can be tough to find though. I nearly pulled the trigger on one last fall that was at a local lot listed at $9995, but I'd just fixed the A/C on my old Dodge and wanted to milk a few more miles out of it. Here's an example of the truck I'm talking about, pretty close to you I think:http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?car_id=193738093&dealer_id=1149760&car_yea- r=2004&model=B-SERIES&bkms=1135289221158&lang=en&isp=y&start_year=2002&certified- =&search_type=both&distance=100&make=MAZDA&min_price=&address=80211&advanced=&en- d_year=2004&max_price=&cardist=9-Jason "
"andre1969","December 2005"," had a Ranger with the 3.0. I think it's either a 2000 or 2001. Sporty model called an ""Edge"" or something like that. I know he's well up over 100,000 miles on it, and has run the hell out of it. He used to work as a courier for a real estate title company. The truck still looks great, but sounds horrible. It's nasty enough on start-up that sometimes it'll wake me up if he starts it early enough! :surprise: And on more than a few occasions, I'd be out early walking the dog in the yard, and he'd scare the crap out of me when he started it up! For lack of a better word, the thing shrieks. He used to have a '75 Valiant with a slant six that he sold back in the spring, and I swear that sucker was whisper quiet, and the epitome of sophistication compared to that Ranger! "
"jjtj","December 2005"," FWIW, I bought a 99 Ranger Xcab with the 3.0L new.. I sold it last year and I still miss it. It was one of the best vehicles I've owned. The 3.0 isn't the best, in particular, it would ping unless higher grade gas is used. Ford can reprogram the ECM to retard the timing, but then you lose power, which it only had 150 HP to begin with. Gas was always cheap when I owned it so I just used 89+ and didn't worry about it. Never had a single problem with it, and it was very comfortable with the ext. cab. I wouldn't hesitate for a minute to buy another. "

We have explored every single option the last couple of days trying to fall off the wagon but, yet again, there is no car better than the Accord for the money. The only one that would make us both happy is probably a TL. I don't think it's worth it to trade the Accord alone for the TL so that's out. We did consider trading both the MDX and the Accord for a TL but I would hate to see the Accord go and I like the size of the MDX for trips with my nieces in tow. Obviously, we think very highly of the Accord. It's way more comfortable for me than the 05 RX330 Gee has had as a loaner while his LS is in the shop. "

"racer63","December 2005"," While I haven't posted much here lately, I have been keeping current with all the various adventures being shared. Been making a few of my own.Mrs. Racer63 is allowing me to look at cars, and has extended the leash suprisingly long with what I am considering. The family fleet at the moment consists of an '86 Honda Civic that is race prepped as an autocross car - no chance of driving to the supermarket for a gallon of milk in that beast, a 2004 GMC 2500HD Crew Cab that serves as the family truckster, and is her daily driver, and a 2000 Toyota Celica GT, about to hit six figure mileage that I wail upon.I feel the ""need"" for something fun, and also that says ""I've arrived"". I also really could use a normal car with 4 doors, considering we currently have only either my girly coupe or her monster truck at our disposal. While the Toyota has been exceeding reliable, except for multiple trannys covered under warranty, I figure I only have about another 30k miles, or 2 years at my current mileage accrual, before moderately expensive repair/replacements will be needed. Most of my choices involve keeping the Celica as a beater, putting off dealing with the future daily driver issue for now.My shopping list is as follows:Frivolous: New Miata, new Solstice, used 00-01 Boxster SPrice - $22k to $32k + always needing a daily diver aroundSolves all the needs and wants: Used 04-05 330i 4 dr w/ Performance Pkg = nice car, and if the Toyota goes kaput, it wouldn't necessarily need to be replaced.Price - $32k +/-Practical: New Mazda 3 (or Accord?), to use as another 6 yr/100k daily driver; sell Celica and Honda, and then find a fun show-off car.Price, with S-plan OTD - $17k + then finding the appropriate fun-mobile, without distractions arising that would prevent me doing the 2nd purchase. A S2000 was on the list, but Mrs. is not comfortable in it. My 8 & 9 year olds want me to get a C5 Z06 Corvette, but that is just a little too extreme, and spendy as well.After starting off this escapade with the 330 as the front runner, I had backed off going in the Miata direction, with a side detour to Solstice. Somewhere along there I realized for $30k +/- would get me into a relatively late model CPO Porsche.  But before that point I ended up thinking practical with a Mazda 3. Now all that has come kind of full circle after having an appropriately packaged 330i end up on a local dealer's lot, that I went on a test drive with today. A sweet car I could get very used to.Anyone care to help me get less confused? "

The new Dakota is also not going to win any beauty contests. Racer, I'm with you on this one. My 96 Ranger XL Extended Cab 4-cyl, 5-speed has 240,000 on it and is still running great. It's starting to show its age a bit and it has a lot of dents and scratches, but mechanically seems to be in good shape and the interior is immaculent, not even a hole in the vinyl floor covering.Granted, the Ranger is not a truck you want to go drag racing in, but if you need an inexpensive, reliable, easy to maintain truck its really hard to beat.

"andre1969","December 2005"," I've heard it get slammed for style too, but truthfully I think it's one of the better looking smaller trucks out there. IMO, most other trucks, like the Dakota, Tacoma, and Frontier, are overstyled. Their proportions are awkward, too many creases, features like oversized headlights or poor-fitting grilles that just don't flow well with the rest of the design, etc.In contrast, the Ranger just has a clean, uncluttered look about it. It's not going to wow anyone with its cutting edge style, but at the same time it's not going to look grotesquely outdated like a car with tailfins would have by 1962, or a mid-70's mastodon in the early 80's.Now I actually like the look of the Colorado and Canyon, although they're more cluttered and ""busy"" than the Ranger. I guess there's just a simple sort of honesty that the Ranger seems to exude, kinda like a broken in pair of jeans that you don't want to throw away, even though they've got holes in the knees and other places.I liked the '97-04 style of Dakota, which had I thought did the ""baby Ram"" look pretty well, and still seemed clean and well-proportioned. The new one just seems awkward, though.The Frontier and Tacoma might be great trucks, but if I was in the mood for a cheap little workhorse (and if I could fit in it...can't remember the last time I've been in a Ranger), I might be tempted by a Ranger.

Given my sporting intent with whatever I get, I did manage to trip over a M030 Sport Chassis example fairly close by. They are even more of a needle in a haystack than a ZHP 330. This one is CPO at a Porsche dealer, and the warranty does run basically bumper to bumper for 2 years.

I also figure I'd never sell it, because nothing would ever go wrong with it, and just give to my now 8 year old daughter in 9 years when she starts to drive; chick car that they are. :surprise:I'm going to be real busy at work the begining of the week (so much for getting Monday the 26th off), but Thursday/Friday plan to drag everyone around once more to see where the pendulum swings.....

"corvette","December 2005"," ...also make a true mini-truck with nice 4-cyl/5-speed that will get 30 or better on the highway. Any manufacturer could easily do this now by taking their existing compact truck and putting a four-cylinder turbodiesel in it... Once one company does it, it will be like the crew-cab compact trucks, those that are late to market (I'm thinking of GM in that instance) will be left wondering why they didn't think of that. (I know GM thought of the crew-cab S-10/Sonoma and sold them in South America, but not here, for many years.) "
"woodyww","December 2005"," Racer, sounds like you've got some good ideas there--I should ask you about some of my car dilemmas.The Boxers are gorgeous, I think, real eye candy. Only slightly less so than the 911. The E46 ZHP at the audi dlr--what does it have for options, like xenons, etc? Hard to know what kind of low price they might take the last week of the year. Have you done a search for CPO versions listed by bmwna? Often bmw dealers are the devil to get a good price out of on a used car. But my current bmw I saw listed for months at a bmw dlr out in the sticks. The price kept coming down. Finally I went in on Dec. 30 & got the lowest price I'd seen at the time for that year & model, CPO, etc. And it was the lowest mileage one I'd seen. So I now believe in that shopping end-of-month, end-of-year stuff. Also the bmw dlr out in the sticks was way nicer than the snotty urban ones around here..... "

I think I remember when you could buy little Mitsu p/u's with diesels (?).....then there were those weird little VW ""Rabbit"" diesel p/u's from the late '70's.I had one of those tiny, tinny ""mini-trucks"" from the mid-eighties (a Toyota), that had the crash protection of a motorcycle. I wouldn't want to go back to that. What kind of mileage does a gas engine Taco w/stick shift, get anyway? "
"michaellno","December 2005"," He's decided to hang on to the Saturn for the time being. I think he really doesn't want to spend the extra money on a higher payment, not to mention higher insurance premiums, at the present time. For the first time in a while, he's got some extra cash in his budget and I think he's enjoying having it too much (income = $1400/mo, obligations = $500/mo) to commit to anything more.Am trying to convince him to make extra payments on the Saturn to pay it off quicker, so that when he does get the itch, he won't be so buried in it. If he can get it paid off, he might be able to get $1000-1500 for it in trade and help him qualify for the loan in his name only, as opposed to having his mother and I cosign.Thanks to one and all for their opinions -- when he does decide to pull the trigger, I feel better that the Ranger might be the best direction for him to go. Would also have him consider Nissan and Mazda as well. "
"jefferyg","December 2005"," Yes, but diesels pose a number of problems as well.1. Many people don't like the noise and smoke. Granted these are not the kind of problems they used to be.2. Diesels are more costly to purchase. If you don't put a lot of miles on a vehicle, you're probably not saving any money.3. Diesel currently costs more than premium unleaded where I live, and I think that is not uncommon across the country.4. Diesels are usually more costly to maintain, although they often outlast gasoline engines. However, with the lower sulfur diesel that is now being produced, I'm not sure that longevity is going to be what it has been.5. Some states already prohibit the purchase of new diesels for personal use, such as in California.The fact is that many of the older pickups with four-bangers and four-speed trannys got close to thirty. I drove a 79 Ford Courier with a 2.0 Mazda engine in it back when I was a teenager. It got 27-30 on the highway. Granted, it was probably not the safest vehicle on the highway.I also had an 89 Ford Ranger with a 4 cyl and 5-speed and it got 27 on the highway. "
"nippononly","December 2005"," ""What kind of mileage does a gas engine Taco w/stick shift, get anyway?""Rated 22/27.So I was at the dealer getting some stuff for my 4Runner the other day, and they have a car that caught my eye: a '98 Accord EX-L 4-cyl sedan. It's an automatic, not my favorite thing, but apart from that I really liked it - took it for a drive. 93K miles, dark green (which I like). Doesn't seem to need anything, except the tires are old - good tread but with lots of cracks, making me think it hasn't been driven much in the last couple years.The dealer's asking price of $10,9 was put on by someone, I think, who was high at the time. They do put on a standard 3-month warranty covering 100% of costs. I took the average of Edmunds, KBB, and NADA Guide, and got a retail value of $8800, so I am thinking of offering them something in the $8K range. The interior is immaculate, but the outside is below average - lots of scratches and dings in the paint, and the alloys are totally scuffed to heck, as they always seem to be on that generation Accord - it was one of those models where the tires don't protect the rims from the curb enough. I am a sucker for dark green cars.... "
"akangl","December 2005"," Sort of. Right now I'm on a friend's computer since I don't have internet yet. I'm still on the hunt for a job with zero luck (starting to worry). The trip was long (11 days) and difficult (bad roads). I'm glad its over. The Titan did an outstanding job of pulling that 4000 lb Uhaul over some of the highest mountains I've ever had to cross. We saw buffalo, caribou, mountain goats, sheep, you name it we probably saw it. The total trip was about 5000 miles, the Titan is now at 34,000 miles.Christmas was fun this year, I hung with my best friend, went to all his family fuctions (met tons of people). Everything was great until Monday night, I was so sick (have been for a few days), I let him drive my Titan and he backed it into a tree busting off the pass side mirror.  You can guess I went slightly (understatement) nuts. New mirror should be in tomorrow, then just have to get it put on. He's used to an Explorer, not the width or the mirrors on my Titan. He now hates my truck, lol.Other than that we are all doing fine, I'm happy for the first time in a long time. That's about it from here, Texas weather is definatly different. "

"woodyww","December 2005"," What year/model is your 4Runner? I've ""almost"" bought a 4Runner several times over the years. Recently I saw a 2000 LTD 4wd with 44K miles go for about $14K-something-I think-on ebay. Seemed like a lot of vehicle for the $$, & w/in driving distance of me. Of course the current gen is supposed to be a lot better.I like dark green cars too, some of the Toyota trucks/SUVS have had a nice dark green option over the years..... That Accord--high miles, old tires, *lots of scratches and dings in the paint, and the alloys are totally scuffed to heck*. I totally don't know the prices, but if ""retail"" is $8800,I'd be thinking $6K-ish--maybe-- to take on a 100K miles, 8-9 y.o. Accord. And I'd start deducting from that for the tires, paint, etc. I think if you paid $8K for this gem they'd do cartwheels all the way to the bank, & then hold their breaths until the check cleared. "
"nippononly","December 2005"," Well, my 4Runner is a boring silver. Because I was insistent on a stick shift for that purchase, I didn't get to be too choosy about colors. Mine is a MY 2000, the last year they had the stick. The LTD 4WD with only 44K would be a raging bargain in my area at $14K. It would go for around $17K in a private sale, and probably $20K or so properly prepped and sold by a dealer. The new one got huge, too big for my purposes, and for those of many 4Runner devotees over the years. OTOH, Toyota did pull in a whole DIFFERENT crowd of buyers (a slightly bigger crowd) by supersizing it, and it didn't hurt that they superengined it at the same time. The upcoming FJ is the proper successor to the 2002 4Runner, not the 2003 4Runner. As for the Accord, well, this is why I don't usually go to dealers for used cars...I am a sucker! But I did like the looks of it, and it drove without a hiccup or any funny sounds or smells. To me, it seems that if average retail is $8800, they should take $7000-7500 without a protest, and I don't know that they won't because I haven't even tried yet. But I am not sure there is any point making a $7000 offer on a car stickered at $10,9. Am I just wasting my time? BTW, I hear you on the $6K-ish offer, but I certainly feel like the car would be worth it if I could get it for $7K. It is a nice car with CARFAX and a 3-month B2B warranty included at that price. I figure with a little care it will give me five or six years without a problem, and besides, by then I will probably have gotten bored and traded anyway! :-P "

"nippononly","December 2005"," unbidden, the salesman made a followup call to me today: he says that NADA Guide and Edmunds are ""not for California cars"", but rather for ""cars in places that rust more"". Interesting! :-)He says they use KBB to govern their purchase price, and so use KBB to price them on the lot. I asked him why their car was $1000 over Kelly, he had no answer. Yup. I told him a $7500 price would prevent me from looking anywhere else, knowing he would say ""go look elsewhere"", which is exactly what he did! He hinted they would probably take an offer in the $9K range. I dunno, at $9K I would take a pass. At $8K, it would still be in the running. For now, I am going to go look at a couple of much newer, lower-miled, gas-sipping Corollas.

You can buy a brand new base Accord for what, $18K (I think), or brand new Civic for around that. So $7500 for a 100K, 8 y.o. one just doesn't compute somehow.....P.S. Don't just go on what the books say. Ask Terry on the RWTIV board, or there are other people here who seem to know the values of cheaper, older cars.

An except follows:Terri and I have ordered new Corvettes, which we hope to pick up at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green the week after next. Mine is a Z06, which is very hard to obtain unless you are willing to pay 10 or 20 K over list. I was in frequent contact with a salesman at Kerbeck Corvette in Atlantic City, since they are the world's largest dealer and sell their Z06s at list. By ordering Terri's car from him (well below list), I became a preferred customer, and by remarkable luck a Z06 came available the same day--guess it was a right place, right time sort of thing. The customer delayed because he wasn't sure about color, my salesman got his foot in the door for that order because he has been there 11 years, and he gave it to me, rather than any of (maybe) fifty other guys who have been hounding him. I had to decide about color on the spot or lose the order to someone else, but I have been looking at them on line for months, and decided on orange metallic--the salesman says it looks good in person, but we'll see.My 1968 Charger RT is almost finished. Maybe a month or two. I have the engine running, but it needs exhaust pipes and muffler before I can do much tune-up. It also needs the interior put in, which won't take long. The exterior is done and looks sharp--cherry red.I really think it's time to go visit Gersh again.james "

"nippononly","January 2006"," I have renewed my CCBA membership twice in three months, a record even for me. For some time, I have been tossing around all sorts of different thoughts for something to buy that would get me good fuel economy while being easy and cheap to drive around town, swerving from old Corollas to newer Accords, to finally contemplating picking up either a new Fit or Yaris later this year (as I was repeatedly disillusioned by the local used car market).But then Toyota released the Yaris pricing, and I realized that with the exception of standard A/C, this car will be the same price as the outgoing Echo. So I began to figure, why buy new? That realization coincided with not one but two Echos going up on the on-line inventory page at San Francisco Toyota. I just had to check them out..................and YES, I have now purchased the ugliest car to come out of the Toyota factory in quite some time! :-)Picked up an '02 Echo manual shift 4-door, A/C, CD, cruise (but wind-up windows and push-button locks) with 60K on it and a certified warranty, for $9K, which includes new tires. So far I love it. C&D did a comparo 18 months ago between two hybrids and the Echo and a Jetta diesel. Needless to say, they didn't like the Echo, the cheapest car of the group by far. But they did manage 41 mpg in 75-80 mph highway driving, and 42 mpg around town.....and this is the leadfoots at a car magazine. So, I am hoping for great things. I have done 100 miles so far and the gauge hasn't even dropped to 3/4 from full. And it is wonderful to drive a car that is fast and nimble without resorting to massive tires and a monster engine, but rather just through the tried and true method of reducing weight - this thing has a curb weight of about 2100 pounds. A lot like an old Tercel I had for a little while years ago, only much better. So anyway, with the membership renewed, I will now happily allow it to run out sometime in a couple of years, as I take active measures to quench the new car itch and stick with the two vehicles I have, both of which fit me perfectly. 2010 here I come without any further purchases, I hope. I know, I know, heresy! :-POK, speech over! :-) "

"andre1969","January 2006"," looked at Echos back in 2002 when he wanted something cheap and economical to run back and forth to work in. I think most of them were priced in the high $14K range, equipped about like Nippon's, although with an automatic tranny. So I'm guessing Nippon's might have been around $14K brand-new?It was also hard to find them on the lots back then, at least around here. If you were lucky the dealers might have had one or two. My uncle originally wanted a true stripper with a stick, no a/c, etc. but none of the dealers could locate one, and even told him the factory would probably refuse to even build it if he ordered one! He ended up with an '03 Corolla (they came out very early in the year...he bought his Memorial Day weekend 2002) that really didn't sticker for much more. Around $15,600 IIRC. "
"nippononly","January 2006"," this car would have been right around $14K brand new. They wouldn't come down further on price on this one because of the certified warranty, but since that is actually worth a few hundred dollars for my peace of mind, I went ahead. I actually went to the dealer with an eye on a green '99 Corolla they had, with 72K miles, automatic. It had just passed the point of being on the road seven years, so was not certified. They had it priced at an outrageous (IMO) $9888, and after dickering for longer than I cared to, they just would not come down below $8600. There was nothing special about the Corolla, in fact, it only had a cassette player, it had ""Dark Horse"" tires (el cheapo brand), but of course had the full power package plus cruise. But since for me the power package is overrated, I decided to go $400 more on a more basic, uglier car with fewer miles, the warranty, better gas mileage, and a CD player. Not to mention, a stick instead of the automatic. After having done a couple of hundred miles in it now, I am very satisfied with the decision. I like funky-ugly cars, I am just weird that way. I actually think the Echo has a cute face, it is just the stuff behind the A-pillar that makes it look like a rolling egg. :-PI am gleefully hoping for 40 mpg on this tank: I am just below half a tank on the gauge with about 240 miles driven. I hope it doesn't disappoint. And quite accidentally, I now have two silver cars, after I said to myself two years ago that silver was so over and I wasn't buying any more silver cars! :-) "

Your new Accord will probably end up with a lot of miles on it, but I've never thought that matters so long as you enjoy it.

Well now, the second one died.. He is fed up and wants to sell. Honda is known for weak transmissions and the car had only 100k miles. The sad part is that he paid $9500 for this car and is right now in no condition to sell. He looked past good used cars of other brands with lesser mileage and got unlucky.

"jjtj","January 2006"," I think it depends on the application as far as appearance goes.. however, I don't think most people take into account the increase in rolling mass that they are adding to the vehicle. This can drastically reduce ride quality and increase wear on ball joints and other suspension parts. It also puts way too much load on the OE braking system, which becomes a safety factor. And if the overall tire height goes much beyond factory, you effectively numerically lower your gear ratio which negatively affects acceleration, and distort the factory speedo & odometer calibration. Not that I'm against aftermarket wheel/tire upgrades, just some things to keep in mind. "

The MDX rides rather stiffly to start out with.Now I have noticed a little decreased stopping power and the gas mileage has decreased a bit according to the trip computer. And for that reason I'm not as happy as I thought I would be. I got the wheels for half price but one of them is slightly bent. There is a little jiggle at higher speeds. I may have done it myself but I'm not sure. There's a wheel repair shop close though.I'm not sure how long I'm gonna keep em on the rig. I love the way it looks. And it drives and handles fine. But knowing they are sucking up so much power concerns me. I hate that gas mileage computer. My Civic Si had 17's on it and they effected it the same way. I had the OEM's put back on right before I sold it and it drove like a different car. I just didn't have a mileage readout glaring me in the face. "

"woodyww","January 2006"," I find the look of wheels can be so subjective. And it's really hard to tell until you get them on your car, unless you see the exact wheels on the same vehicle as yours. I bought an almost new set of bmw 17""s for my 5 series a couple of years ago & didn't like the look much (just because of that particular style, not the size). But I sold them for about what I paid.I do recall the stock tires on the MDX as looking a tiny bit.....skinny maybe, for the size of vehicle. But personally, I think the craze for giant rims has gotten a little bit nuts. I remember when some of the hottest cars--60's Pontiac Firebirds & GTO's, etc, had 14"" wheels. "

"mark156","January 2006"," Corvette, you are right, I don't see many spinners around either.I'll never forget going to the Lincoln Mercury dealer near my home in California and looking at a new Navigator. Next to the MSRP sticker was an addendum sticker showing the price for new low profile tires and huge spinner rims... posted at $11,000! That pushed the MSRP to over $70,000 for a Navigator. I was absolutely shocked.First, I just don't care for the look of over-sized wheels on car/trucks. Now that it has been brought to our attention that changing factory wheels to over-sized wheels and how it can effect suspension parts, ride and gas mileage, I like them even less.But, a car is a personal toy and if someone likes them covered in after market parts, wheels, gold, etc, more power to them. I just find it unattractive.Mark  "
"woodyww","January 2006"," I find over-sized wheels--well, it depends on the wheels. But esp. with the bright chrome ones from after-market mfgs., usually on SUVs, bmw's, & Mercedes, often look garish to me, & imo can make the vehicle look like it belongs to an LA gang-banger or drug dealer. With bmw's, I rarely think they look ""right"" unless they have actual bmw wheels. Fortunately, bmw usually makes about a zillion styles & sizes for each range of models over the years, so there are lots to choose from. Sometimes you can even use wheels from say a 7-series--or whatever--on other models if you get ""fitment rings"" from the tire rack.I think I mentioned I had these beautiful factory 18"" alloys on my '98 Range Rover. But I'm glad I never had to buy new tires for it--I shudder to think. "
"corvette","January 2006"," That was how I chose the wheels for my winter tires--which ones at Tire Rack most closely resembled a set of factory wheels. It still really changed the look of the car, but I like it. "
"ghulet","January 2006"," ...about oversized wheels and tires: first, I think if cars were meant to have 20"" wheels and tires, they'd be manufactured with them (with the manufacturers reaping the profits instead of the aftermarket), just from ride/handling/suspension wear/safety standpoints. Second, I don't generally like how oversized wheels look, I don't need the extra attention from the 'kids', let alone from cops or thieves, which given my usual luck would be their main attractors. Third, don't 'normal' wheels and tires cost enough? Geez, last time we got tires for my brother's Blazer (a nothing-special car with nothing-special 235/15s), they were around $500 installed, for Firestones, not exactly the best brand around any more (forgive me, we were in Indianapolis); were they nice Michelins or something, probably more like $700-800. I may be in a different tax bracket than everyone else here, but that's a lot of money to me. Why would I want to spend twice as much on tires that wear out twice as quickly or on wheels that attract what I consider to be negative attention and get bent up in our wonderful Chicago potholes? I don't get it, sorry. Not to be negative, but have any of you with apparently endless automotive budgets considered doing something a bit more constructive, like, I dunno, paying off your mortgages or putting money into an IRA or a college fund? I must be getting old or something, sorry for the rant! :P "
"andre1969","January 2006"," that reminds me, I'm going to have to get new tires soon for my Silverado (235/75/R15). Funny thing is, even on a full-sized truck like this, I don't think the wheels look under-sized. Now it might help some that they're those 15x8 truck rallye wheels, so while they're nothing special when it comes to diameter, they're very thick, especially for that era, so they have a nice, filled-out look to them.Now you'd think that on a big car, those big 20's, Dubs, or whatever they call them might not look too bad, but I think that sometimes they look even worse on a big car than a small one. Most small cars nowadays are pretty tall, especially in proportion to their length, so sometimes it almost seems like they need a bigger wheel to fill them out. But with really big cars that have oversized aftermarket wheels, like some 70's mastodon, it ends up making them seem buffoonish, and they come off looking like some HotWheels toy. There's a local guy who has a '75-76 Electra hardtop sedan with rims that must be 20"" or so, and it looks just awful. The car itself is very attractive, kind of a platinum color with matchng tinted windows, but those wheels just mess it up. This dude actually stopped off at my house one day when I wasn't home, and asked my roommate if I'd be interested in selling my '79 NYer. God only knows what he might have done to that! Although I guess I shouldn't talk...after all right now it has 15x7 wide offset copcar rims on it, little dog-dish hubcaps, and raised white letter Firestone Firehawks!  "

"michaellno","January 2006"," The saga continues.In our last episode, the michaell family had decided to sell one of their three vehicles this summer and have the daughter attend college sans transportation.However, that seems to have changed. It turns out that the daughter would like to have a car at school, she just doesn't want to have to work part time in order to pay for the insurance and gas.Sounds like a dilemma, eh?Well, with the FIL passing away, there was a small inheritance that we should be getting in a month or so. It would be enough to either:A) Pay off the Focus entirely, leaving us with enough money to cover the insurance premium. The daughter would then take either the Focus (if she learns to drive stick, which she is now slightly inclined to do) or the L300.OR Trade in the Focus and put a big down payment on something new for the kid, leaving us with a small payment and insurance which we could cover.Either way, the kid will be financing her own living expenses while at college. We originally agreed to do this with the money that would have gone to the car payment. She would still work on her breaks from school - winter break is 4 weeks long and she will have 3 months in the summer to rebuild her savings account for living expenses.OTOH, the wife is also thinking of taking the inheritance money and either:A) Landscape the backyard; or New carpeting throughout the houseWhat's really funny is that the thing I want to do most with the inheritance - save it - is probably the worst thing to do since we'll have to claim that money when filling out the Federal Financial Aid forms.Stay tuned for next weeks episode of ""As the Car Turns"".

"jjtj","January 2006"," I picked up a new ride yesterday.. I'd been looking for a decent 4-cyl car that gets decent mileage. My truck with a 6.0 V8 gets 15 MPG on a good day, so I figured it would pay for itself in no time.Anyways, I found on craigslist a 1997 Honda Civic DX.. 2-dr coupe, 5-spd, silver. 189K on the clock.. $1000. I saw it late Monday night, and by Tuesday @ 11:00 am, I owned it. Good shape overall, a few dings, one fairly large one on the rear corner but not too big of a deal. Interior is in great shape, never smoked in, even has the embroidered Civic mats. Two new tires on front, backs are still good, recent tune-up, lots of records, owner had it since 16K / 1998. It's silver in color with a dark grey interior. The great thing is that it was owned by an adult couple, so it hasn't received the hoop-dee treatment. Even came with an almost full tank of gas! I'm pretty excited about it.. everything else I looked at for that price was pretty tired, and mostly Escorts & Cavaliers. My brother & I took the Civic up to Detroit today (3 hrs each way) to go to the auto show. Ran like a top at 80 MPH, even across the OH turnpike with 40 MPH headwinds.

Even if you could swap even up, there is still usually some DMV, state, dealer fees to cover.besides, you think a Freestyle can tow the trailer (didn't you bring the TT or something with you)?Depending on the relative values of the trade vs. the new one, and what your needs will be (towing, cargo, etc)., might end up being cheaper to get a economical commuter car. Something like the '97 Civic someone just got, and old Tercel or sprint, something cheap to buy and great on gas.Sort of an older replacement for zippy. "
"michaellno","January 2006"," I think you'd like the Freestyle, though the CVT takes a bit of getting used to. Took one for a test drive when they first came out -- nice, high seating (for a car), interior was pretty nice (it was the Limited model; don't know what trim level you are looking at) and we found it to be more flexible than the Pacifica.Talked with my sister last night -- she's got a ""For Sale"" sign on her Yukon Denali. If she can get the right price for it, she says that they will probably lease an Acura MDX for $399/mo. BIL's lease on his BMW (530i) ends in 18 months or so; sister says that they might buy an Accord Hybrid, since all he does is commute with his car. I told her it was silly to spend $30K for the Hybrid, when they could get a 4-cyl EX-L auto for $23K and get similar mileage. But, with the BIL, it's all about image - he's the comptroller for a mortgage company, and I guess he can't be seen driving something ""ordinary"". "

When we recently traded for an 06 Passat 2.0T the biggest issues were that the car had to be larger than the 03 Civic we'd been driving and the kid's booster seats had to ""fit"" in the back seat. We'd looked at Accords since we've been long time Honda drivers, but when the booster seats didn't ""fit"", she was not interested. Anyway, so far she has really enjoyed the Passat, especially the heated seats. And one thing she said really surprised me. She came home from school one day and told me about other teachers who'd noticed her car. Perhaps image is becoming more important to her. Wives truly are complex, but it's a good thing I have one.

It helps that we got a good deal on the MDX and would break even if not make money on it. We are at about 80% in favor of just keeping it. The only new car we could buy now to replace it is the Ody Touring. The only other options that we can agree on are the upcoming RDX or maybe the redesigned MDX.

The Tempo was on its last legs and so she decided to trade it in for a '97 Escort LX.Same situation - at the time, her kids were 11 and 9, and we had two 4 door sedans to choose from. While the Accord was larger, it didn't have A/C or cruise, so we often took the Escort.A couple of years later, the Escort got traded in for an Expedition, while the Accord was replaced with a VW New Beetle. Talk about extremes! We called them ""Beauty and the Beast"". "

I may also be able to rack up further dollars by spending money on the card, such as putting $9k down on a new vehicle... the GM Card can be freely used at GM dealers.This brings up a couple of points:- over two months to go means I could special-order something, say, a Silverado reg cab w/ a stick. With air, cruise, and not much else, it would be $12 or $12,500 + TTL. - For around $2,5 to $3k, I could upgrade my '04 25k Vibe to a similar '06... and maybe pick up side air bags and a sunroof in the bargain... the extras would be extra, of course.- Or I could do nothing, being as I am happy with what we've got.What do you-all say? :-)-Mathias "
"stickguy","January 2006"," use it baby. THe Vibe idea (if you want to own one for the duration) sounds good, but I refuse to own a car without a moonroof, so I might not be unbiased.Hard to argue with the truck deal, if you need one. It could replace your endless supply of beaters to tote the canoe, and at least you won't have to strap it on the roof.Should be able to keep it for a long time without getting hit too hard on depreciation, since you probably won't put many miles on it.I assume the PU would be an addition to the fleet, so there would be a real cost to it, or would you sell the Vibe to get it?

"ghulet","January 2006"," ....about the whole RSX v. Civic debate, but I just helped (well, sort of--she didn't let me haggle, didn't herself, either, so she paid MSRP) a friend purchase a new RSX auto/leather a few weeks ago, after having looked at the Civic (we test drove an EX coupe). She had an Integra previously, and the RSX is supposedly built off the last-gen Integra platform, so it was a natural. Basically, the only real 'beefs' she had with the Civic were the somewhat vague (in Honda tradition) steering, the spaceship dashboard and instrument cluster in general (she's 4'11"", so certain things were a reach, and the dashboard seems about four feet deep what with the windshield rake). Worst, though, were those damn digital instruments. I think those will be a deal killer for more than a few people, never mind that the rest of the car is a home run. Didn't help that at the time, nobody had any Civic coupes on the lot, and she was eager to get something new. "

I take the bus into work for free which drops me off at my house so this car is only going to be used for nights and weekends (approximately 4K miles a year).I haven't driven any of the cars you mentioned yet except did try a Mazdaspeed Protege but was a bit pricy.

"nippononly","January 2006"," Oh well, if headroom is an issue, the Focus might work better than the Protege, but it's still worth a try. The little Impreza I used to have had good headroom, but it is AWD and not such a used car bargain. Plus hard to find used because so few are sold. I hesitate to mention my own most recent purchase, because it's not for everyone, but if you want outstanding headroom in a cheaper used car with great gas mileage, you could do worse than a used Echo. Sales fell off after '02, but you could probably get an '00-'01 for around the price you mentioned.The current model Elantra goes back that far too, and seems to have held together pretty well, with a decently high roof. I would recommend a Civic, but at least around here $7K wouldn't buy you a 5 year old Civic. If you live someplace besides the west coast where they aren't as popular, maybe you could get one of those. The late 90s to early '00s model had good headroom. "
"corvette","January 2006"," I got one of those in the mail as well. I have something like $1700 and they offered a top-off to $3000. I have the new GM card, which has a maximum limit depending upon which GM vehicle you're buying. My dad has the old card, which (I think) lets him rack up $500 per year for up to seven years and use it on any vehicle. IMO, Ford has the best-built full-size pickup right now, although it doesn't offer the safety features that Toyota, Nissan, and Honda do. Also, GM should be introducing a new model within a year or so. I stopped using my GM card to get earnings a long time ago, but kept the account open in case I ever had the occasion to use the points. It looks like they will start expiring in 2008. "
"steine13","January 2006"," Well, *need* is a four-letter word in CCBA land, but we sure could use a pickup truck with a cap for my wife's antique business... as it sits, she will take the seats out of the minivan, load it up, and then it's a hauling vehicle for the season. Reconfiguring it is a major pain, so the Vibe becomes the family vehicle. I'm not a big fan of 600 pounds of unsecured cargo with no safety cage... a fs truck would fix that aspect.I should also mention that the missus steine13 has not yet, uh, ""warmed up"" to the Civic. As it were.In that context, a truck would make sense... at present rebates, and given the inventory at my favorite dealer, I ""shud"" be able to buy a base truck with cruise and the better cloth and *auto* [all they got] for $14 OTD.

"mark156","February 2006"," Well Guss, having a Rolls as a winter beater in the desert can't get any better!I started first grade in 1964; my understanding is a 1964 Rolls had a MSRP of $18,000 way back then when a normal car ran about $2,200 (if anyone knows for sure I will stand corrected). I call my old car a ""20 footer"" as it looks showroom fresh from 20 ft.... get a little closer and you can see the very small stress cracks at the ""A"" pillar and ""C"" pillar because the car is not ""unibody"". I get a lot of compliments when driving it so it makes it worth every penny when it needs something for repair. It's a lot of bang for the buck as a new Rolls Phantom is $350,000. :P Mark "
"guss","February 2006"," And I bet you get alot of people straining their necks to see who you are driving around in the back seat.A Rolls is a truly interesting second car.I bet you get asked to drive in alot of parades. "
"andre1969","February 2006"," Wow, Mark, beautiful car! FWIW, by 1964 I think something like a Chrysler Newport or Dodge Custom 880 would've probably base priced around $3000 for a 4-door sedan. And I'd guess an Impala would've based around $2500-2600? By that time, once you equipped them about the same, many low-line cars like Chevies and Fords ended up costing about the same as higher-priced marques like Dodge, Chrysler, and Buck. I doubt $2200 would've gotten you much of a car by then...maybe something like a stripper Biscayne? And probably various basic compacts and a few intermediates?But then at the same time, my grandparents bought a new house in 1964, 3 bedroom/2 bath all-brick rambler with a full basement and a carport for around $23,000. That car definitely looks like a lot of bang for the buck! How long have you had it? "
"mark156","February 2006"," Hey Andre, I have had the car for almost eight years. When I first got the car, I had the rear window motors replaced (only $75 each; GM part). Over the 7.5 years, I've replaced the radiator, water pump, belts/hoses, new set of Coker wide white-wall radials (what a difference!), rebuilt speedometer, new clock and recently a major tune-up and carburetor repair. The repairs probably have run about $5,000 and the new tires were $2,200. Even at that, I can still get all of my money back or close to it. The car gets ""rarer"" as everyday passes just like your collection! Mark "
"fintail","February 2006"," I have a car from that same year tooIt cost about $7000 new (as a higher line car) IIRC. It's going to get a set of factory style wide whites when the current tires wear or rot out (they are 7 years old now). "
"mark156","February 2006"," Fin, what are the ""amenities"" in the interior? Leather? Power windows/locks? Power seats, etc?In the Rolls, I have:-6.25 liter V8-power steering-power brakes-power windows-split front seat; manual movement, manual recline-leather interior-NO power locks-factory air conditioning-suspension switch which effects the dampers for spirited driving -low fuel light-oil level check (separate button when pushed, it uses the gas gauge to let you know the oil level) The ""oil"" readings are in red, the gas readings are in white.-electric fuel door release-wood picnic tables on the back of the front seats-windscreen washers (not working)-electric radio antenna-fog lights-interior map lightAlso, the Rolls does not have ""Park"", the gear shift is on the column and starts with Neutral, then 4, 3, 2. Reverse is on the bottom. Reverse acts as Park when the engine is off. There is a huge yellow light on the dash so when you pull the emergency brake there is no question you are secure.The Power Brakes work off the servo on the transmission, (I'm not a mechanic so I hope that I explain this correctly) so, I have power brakes most of the time. The only time that there is an issue, is when you press the brake and let off, then press again.. if the car has moved less than 3 feet, there are NO POWER BRAKES, which is scary. The servo on the transmission has to make a full revolution to ""keep"" power brakes. That's when parallel parking becomes fun! :P In the manual, there is a diagram on how to load luggage in the ""boot"". Since the trunk lid is so slanted, it seems that it wouldn't hold much but if you follow the diagram, you can put a good bit back there.And.... I have the flying lady hood ornament!Happy Motoring!

I guess that's why the fluids are always fresh, ""auto"" change the old fashioned way!The engine was made with weep holes that leak. I do have a small leak in the power steering gear box that I will live with.

"andre1969","February 2006"," Rolls Royce didn't go to GM for power steering pumps like they did with the power window motors...they're a dime a dozen! Well, relatively speaking!One nice thing about having a car you don't drive alot is that you can sometimes let problems go. For instance, I've had my '67 Catalina almost 12 years and around 11,000 miles now, and have been nursing a leaky transmission the whole time.  It actually doesn't leak too bad if the car gets driven regularly, but let it sit too long and there will be a pink puddle on the garage floor. I ended up ""borrowing"" one of those big plastic trays that the pizza dough comes in from when I used to work that job, and use it to catch the fluids. "

I think ultimately they were forced to move the ""R"" because too many people would accidentally shift into Reverse when they were trying to downshift.Hey, I always wondered...how did those old automatic emptying ashtrays work?

"mark156","February 2006"," geo9, I'm not sure when RR started or stopped using GM parts. My mechanic said RR had used GM window motors for many years, especially in the older ones.Speaking of the N432R (transmission configuration). I have to be very careful if I have the car valeted. When I would go to the Ritz Carlton for lunch with friends, there was a valet there that understood how it worked. How scary it could be if a young valet jumped in and started to drive away and thought the car was in Park (really neutral) and pull down one gear thinking you are in Reverse when you are actually in Drive... not pretty!Andre, I never heard of the ashtrays that you were referring to. The Silver Cloud III was made from 1963, 1964 and 1965. Before that they were called the Silver Cloud I and Silver Cloud ll. The Silver Cloud III came out with the dual headlamp configuration.In 1966, the Silver Shadow was introduced and ran until 1980, then came the Silver Spur (1981-1998) then the Silver Seraph (1999-2003) then the Phantom (2004-current). Also during those years, there were special versions called the Silver Wraith, Silver Ghost, etc.I have a friend who bought a new Phantom and is having the top chopped off to make a four door convertible. It has been in it's ""transformation"" for over a year now. At this point, it will be the only Phantom that is a four door convertible. The whole interior was stripped to add strengthening bars and the whole trunk lid had to be redesigned as to have a boot for the top to go into. Also, all new glass had to be made because there is no ""B"" pillar and the glass needed to touch (like the suicide-door Lincolns). The inside of the doors had to be re-built to accomodate the larger glass. This job was ONE BIG undertaking and cost a fortune! :sick: Mark  "
"andre1969","February 2006"," I wonder if that's just a myth, then? I just just remember hearing years ago that Rolls Royces had self-emptying ashtrays.

"racer63","February 2006"," Some of y'all may have seen my whining in Smart Shopper in the ""Any Questions for a Car Dealer"" thread. Guess I had it coming to me trying to decide between things as varied as a used Boxster S or Z06 to a used 4-door mid/full size domestic, to something in between.Spent a gloomy Saturday out kicking tires on the practical-to-slightly upscale front, starting off at the GM dealer that I bought the 2500HD Crew Cab from. They had two things intriguing. An '05 Grand Prix with 13,000 miles, and a Certified '03 CTS with 35,000. Grand Prix was advertised at 16,995; the CTS at 22,995. The grand Prix was a pleasant suprise, and the CTS was a disappointment, which wasn't all that unexpected, having ridden in one about year ago and getting out not impressed. All sorts of ride harshness and crashes through the suspension. My 100k mile Celica with Koni shocks rides better. I also had to jack the seat all the way to the floor, with the cushion totally flat, to get my head out of the sunfoof. The net of the adjustment was it felt like a wooden church pew with somebody patting my head. The Poncho was offered to me at $15,500 right off the bat. I imagine there is about another $500 of play in the price if I pushed. If I went with that ""plain"" a cat though, I think I'd want something down in the thirteen range.Then on to the Lincoln Mercury dealer right next door, which had a bunch of LS's lined up. The best color combo I liked was no-sale dark blue with a gray interior. 2003 V8 with 14,000 miles; asking price of $22,995. Supposedly has never left the dealership, but was titled and used by the owner or Mrs. owner since the 4/04 in service date. Wow, lotta car and bling for that price, considering the $40k+ sticker new. As someone who learned to drive in a '72 Vega with metal and plastic interior and a 3 speed manual on the floor (in 1980!), having heated and cooled front and rear seats, power tilt/telescope wheel, power seats that go back in their tracks when the car is shut off (wife was like what the heck?) this ride was shweet. My problem is that I don't necessarily need all those buttons to push, and I'm sure some of them might break over time too. :confuse: So, on to the Philadelphia Auto Show next weekend, to try to keep figuring out what to do.

She just feels totally uncomfortable in the car.. Add in the loss of passenger space... and the benefits of top-down driving don't seem worth it to her...The hardtop would help visibility... and a little on the noise... but, unless you never want to use the convertible, you'd still have 7 months per year that it would have to be off.. plus the $3000 cost :surprise: The good thing is... I think I can get out of it, with little or no extra cost above the monthly payments that we've made.... That isn't true with a lot of leases..

"qbrozen","February 2006"," Can't go wrong with the LS, in my biased opinion.There should even be wiggle room in that price. It was just 4 months ago I picked up my '03 LS. At that time, the real-world trade-in value of one with 30k miles was in the low $18k range. Given the low miles and extra options (mine doesn't have heated rear seats) of the one you are looking at, that should kick up the price a bit, but it is 4 months later now. SO... I'm thinking its about a wash and the trade-in should still be in the low to mid $18s. Does it have Nav? If so, maybe wandering to that $19k number. Even if its certified, I think you should be able to get them down to $21-$21.5.Just realize the mileage might hurt ya. I get a hair above 21.5 mpg running premium gas with about 80% highway driving.

So, we put our feelers out and found a 96 Honda Civic EX 5-speed sedan in silver with 127,000 miles for $4000. It appears that it hasn't been wrecked. It's clean and pretty ding-free for the age and mileage. Interior is real clean and it's a non-smoker. If we get it inspected and it comes back clean we will probably add this to our fleet until we can get the Civic that Gee wants. Or until we have moved on to the next greatest car. "

Turned out the reduced rate would save me the certification cost over the life of the loan AND THEN SOME. "

"andre1969","February 2006"," is that a car with 200K miles is something that you give away, simply to get it off your hands. Unless it's had some major work put into it. For instance, my '68 Dart had 253,000 miles on it when I bought it. I paid $1700 for it back in 1992. It had a rebuilt 318 with only 11,000 miles on it though, and a used, but newer tranny and rear end. And a killer sound system! :shades: I paid $250 for my '79 Newport, which I bought from the junkyard. I thought it only had 130,000 miles on it, but it was more like 230,000!My Mom gave me her '86 Monte Carlo with 179,000 miles on it. When it got totaled, with 192K on it, the insurance company gave me around $2200 for it.Interestingly I did another Autobytel search and found a 1996 Lumina LS sedan for sale for $4999, with around 96,000 miles on it. So if you just go by asking prices, sometimes the domestics and Japanese don't seem that far off in price. But then I'm sure those Accords I found will get snatched up, while that '96 Lumina will just sit at that price, and ultimately get sold for $2-3K, at best. "

"perna","February 2006"," $22k for a new Civic? Either the prices of cars have gone up significantly since I bought my '03 Maxima 3 years ago, or I got the steal of the year for $23.5k OTD. I realize NAV adds quite a bit, but for the amount of time that most people use NAV, you're better off with a $300 Garmin. I checked out the new Civic at the auto show last week, and the interior has improved from years past, but it is still clearly an econobox. The Ford Fusion seemed like a much nicer car, and was similarly priced. I test drove one a month or two ago, and the interior and ride were very European. It reminded me strongly of the '96 Jetta I used to own. The Fusion's downfall in my eyes is that even with the V6, it doesn't have quite enough power.That said, I'm beginning to lurk on Edmunds, which usually is the start of my new car buying process. My Max needs new tires and brakes, which on that car is a cool $1k expense. I have a problem, though, in that unless my car has neck-snapping power, four doors, and near-lux interior, I'll tire of it quickly. At the time (02/2003), the Maxima was really the sweet spot in the $20-$30k price range; maybe it still is, I'm not sure. And, apologies to Anony/Gee, but I hate Accords. I favor Nissan over Honda because while they both make cars with fantastic engines and lots of power, Nissan's cars have an ""X"" factor that make them more interesting to me. Plus, like you guys I want factory satellite radio, and Honda only offers XM, whereas Nissan lets you choose. I tried XM for 8 months in the Max, and went back to Sirius recently (primarily due to Sirius' better and more abundant rock channels). I test drove Pontiac's Grand Prix GXP with the 5.3L V8, and that was a fun car to drive. The problem is that the interior still isn't quite there yet; when they rename the car the ""G8"" in a year or two and give it a new platform, it might be worth considering. GM is also XM-only, which is a black mark against them, although apparantly there is a box you can install that will allow you to hook up a Sirius tuner to a GM factory system. If I didn't have a second child due this fall, I'd buy an Infiniti G35x, no question. "

So they are out.I like XM because I feel it has a better dance station format. We have Sirius on our Dish Network system. Don't like it.

I wish Honda saw fit to build a V-6 manual shift Accord without leather. $27,5 is a bit steep when you know they would sticker one without leather at around $26K.And is it just my imagination, or are they using the old Acura CL/TL rims from the last generation for that V-6 manual? The V-6 auto has different rims that I don't particularly care for. Of course, I was trolling around for a look at a Civic EX manual, of which they only had one in black. I think there is some kind of universal conspiracy against me on the part of all the automakers, that when they build sedans with manual transmissions, they will make them black every time. Too bad.

"steine13","February 2006"," Posting from the Vaterland.As far as Civic prices: Yeah, I happen to ""know of"" a 91 Civic Si with 210k that sold for $1,740. A pretty easy flip; the kid that bought it was just drooling over it.If I ever have another Honda, I'm reasonably sure I'll buy it new. The '97 Accord with 107k for just under $5 will probably sell, but I still think that's too much money...I ran my '04 Vibe 5sp silver 25k through NADA; came back with a ""trade-in value"" of $11,600 and a ""retail value"" of $14 and change. Whoa, maybe I should try it on the street for $12,500 and see what gives; I paid $14 OTD for the silly thing in late '04 and if I could get $12 for it, I'd probably drive a Taurus for awhile.Is it just me or have fuel-efficient cars really become that expensive???Before it's all over, I think I'll have to do the right thing and buy another new GM... I honestly believe they'll go bankrupt before '07 is up... which is bad for MI, to say nothing of the rest of the US.

"andre1969","February 2006"," ...post titles today. Anyway, about that '03 GMC I found...it does have an 8-foot bed. But then, I spec'd out a new Sierra/Silverado on Edmund's, and TMV on a new one, fairly basic, is still only around $15K for the bare essentials (automatic, CD player). Still under $16K when you ad the sliding rear window, handling/trailering package, and limited slip rear.So basically I guess I'd be looking at $3-4K more for brand-new, versus an '03 with 41K miles. I guess the '03 caught my eye because of the pretty color and alloys. And that it's a Sierra, which I think looks WAY better than the Silverado. And also, it doesn't seem like the 8-foot bed, regular cab pickups show up often on used car lots around here. "
"nippononly","February 2006"," I was cruising the lot next door to the Toyota dealer last night - P-B-GMC.

This, for a short cab, short bed pick-up. It didn't even have a bedliner, nor was it 4WD. It was apparently an SLE1, so it had a few niceties, and the alloys looked good, but boy. I wouldn't pay that much for it.They had an '07 Yukon there on display, and while it looks decent, I don't really see what all the fuss is about the new looks of the GMT900 trucks. They also had a monstrously huge banner draped across the front of the showroom telling the world there are $5500 rebates on the '06, or 0% financing for 72 months. "

"gee35coupe","February 2006"," I've driven em...And while I will admit they are nice cars, BMW, Benz, and even Porche don't impress me at the prices that they usually command. Especially at the rate they depreciate. After working in the car biz for most of the past decade, you learn that that ""expensive Euro-car bug"" ain't all it's cracked up to be. And even more validation can be had by hanging out in the forums. The C-class thread is the only thread I have ever seen where the regulars regulars warned newbies to avoid that model if they were used to Japanese reliability. Yikes!!!If you'd read back a few months, there was a 2000 or so 540i Sport 6 speed that caught my eye. But not because it was a Bimmer. I wanted it because it was a 6 speed V8 for $16k. Heck, my LS400 wouldn't be in garage if it cost more than the $10k I paid for it 4 or 5 years ago.

"corvette","February 2006"," My theory on the depreciation rates is that the fully-optioned models are not as good a value as the stripped models, unless there's some sort of lease incentive. I think a BMW 330xi sedan that lists for over $50,000 with automatic, nav, sport and premium packages, laser guided cruise control, etc., will retain a smaller percentage of its value than a base 330xi. The resale on either would still be quite impressive compared to a new Cadillac or Lincoln. "
"anonymousposts","February 2006"," say what you want about our Civic or how boring it is but it averaged 37 MPG on the first 5.9 gallons of gas. For 10 years old and 127,000 miles it drives great. No squeaks or rattles, all electricals still work, and the engine is smooth. As for the Maxima being sold OTD for $23,500. That is a good deal. Helped along by the Maxima's slow sales and the upcoming 2004 redesign. We had a dealer offer us a new 2001 SE 6-speed for $19,500 without haggling. We went there looking for a 2002 Altima 5-speed manual (of which they had none) so we pondered the Maxima for a minute. As Gee said before, we hated the idea of a rear axle. Bought a 2000 Civic Si instead. We do shop other brands but it seems like our money always ends up on the Honda. So far that has served us well. I think I am getting to an age where I realize that BMW, MB, etc are more about image than return for the money. IMO, the Accord is an amazingly competent car for the price as is the 96 Civic we just picked up. The Accord is more substance than flash which suits me just fine. "
"sandman46","February 2006"," I tend to agree with you actually. After having seen and sat in the current generation Accord and Civic, I'd have to say that I will be buying Honda the next time.

I must admit our Mazda 3s is a blast to drive though my Sentra is a nice appliance with just so so gas mileage. I want more for my daily driver, and I think the new Civic will fill that desire wonderfully.I just wish I had some justification to trade in the Sentra, but with only 27k miles in 3 years now and the dismal trade in value, I will probaly have to wait until '08 or '09 for my chance.

"perna","February 2006"," Woody: You're right about spending $1k on my Max to not be a gigantic expense, however... as someone who is certified CCB (prior to the Max, the longest I'd owned a new car was 2 yrs), it is a GREAT excuse to buy new. However, I just love my Maxima. The odd thing is that unlike every other car I've owned, it still FEELS like a new car! No rattles, it cleans up very well, no problems with it at all. I'm not gentle with it, either - every corner is a thrill, and the way the car effortlessly gets up to, ah, VERY high speeds never gets old. The lack of IRS on that car was mentioned in auto reviews, but let me tell you it's not something you notice when you're throwing the car around curves or being lifted off your seat by sheer acceleration. In fact, on the crappy Michigan roads I drive on, I don't feel the car is unduly harsh at all (and I have the SE/""sport"" suspension!). The problem I have with Hondas isn't something that I can really quantify. Something about the cars just feels ""wrong"" to me, stupid as that may sound. I just remember, 3 years ago, driving the V6 Accord and feeling ""eh"" about it. It had guts and was fun to drive, but didn't set me on fire. First stretch of road I took in the Maxima, though, I knew I was screwed. Got out of the car, and for the first time EVER I dropped my pants and said to the salesguy, ""I want that car. Let's do a deal."". Lucky for me, as Anony pointed out, the '04s were like 2 weeks out and they REALLY wanted to sell me the '03. :P As far as Civics go, I remember riding in a friend's 2 YO '98, and it was a punishing experience. The seats were park-bench hard, and every bump came crashing through to the interior. At the time, I had a '96 Jetta that felt like a Bentley by comparison (I wish that VW had the Honda's reliability though, lol). An excellent point you two have is that the Nissan interiors do seem cheap to me now. I still feel my '03s interior is worlds better than the ""new"" style Maximas. I think they could also put a few more bucks into the G35's interior for what they're asking. At the Detroit Auto Show they did announce that the '07 Max's interior is going to be completely overhauled, so we'll see. Despite that, and my luck/love with my car, I will probably go with an entirely new make and model. Variety is the elixir of life and all that.  "
"corvette","February 2006"," I never posted my impressions from the Louisville auto show:The Lexus IS250/IS350 that I saw had the front air dam misaligned. There's some sort of seam in the middle of it? It didn't look like it had been hit or anything. Other than that, those cars looked nice. The new RAV4's trim around the spare tire looks weird. Other than that, a nice looking car. The third row would be useless, and none of the three on the floor had the optional third row. The Ford Ranger needed an overhaul a long time ago. I'm not sure what the craze is over the Canyon being a ""mid-size"" truck, the only difference between it and the Sonoma seems to be a little more space in the interior, but the exterior length on the regular cab is about the same as the Sonoma was. The Buick Lucerne has a really ugly steering wheel. All the GM products appear to use the same six-position tilt steering column, and few offer a telescoping wheel. The Impala had some exposed screwheads in the interior. The Dodge Ram megacab is waaay too big. People are talking about the SUV being dead, but it was impossible to sit in the new Tahoe (there was only one there, but plenty of the old model) because there were too many people looking at it. "
"gee35coupe","February 2006"," We do the same thing.....We have only missed one car show int he 11 years we've been together. We are admitted car junkies. That's why Anony created this room. To put it in perspective Anony went while she was 8.5 months pregnant. She had our son 2 weeks later. She's hard core. LOL. Kinda cool having her for a wife. Anyway....We always come back loving our Accord. I like the idea of the Subaru Legacy's AWD but the engine sounds too coarse to me. I don't get where that opposed 4 smoothness comes into play. And I don't fit in an Impreza.The Camry has a nice exterior and drivetrain but I don't like the interior a bit. I recognize the niceness of it, but I just don't like it. The Corolla is nice on the inside and outside, but has an axle, and I don't fit. At all.Mitsubishi...Well it's a Mitsubishi. And they don't make higher end models with manual transmissions and sunroofs. In fact, that manual transmission/sunroof requirement knocks a lot of cars out of the running. Then you have to add a reliability factor and we alway end up with a Honda or Acura. Because even if you bring up the transmission issue, which doesn't really effect my stick-loving family, Honda took care of the situation like a company that values its customers should.That being said though, if we needed another car right now, and they weren't willing to deal on the Civic, we'd probably just buy another used 04-05 Accord EX-L. Can't buy the 03 cause it didn't have XM and we agree the new tail lights are horrid. In fact we'd probably try to find one of the 4 they made with NAV and a 5 speed. There's really nothing else out there that hits every one of our hot-buttons. "
"woodyww","February 2006"," It can get expensive to own bmw's. The only way I've been able to own 2 bmw's, 1 saab 9000 (a ""real"", pre-GM saab), & 1 Range Rover was to buy used ones.

My current E39 5-series, has probably dropped 40-50% in value in 4 years (I paid $34K used). Not great, not horrendous. If I didn't like the car so much I'd be ticked about the depreciation on it probably.If they still made an Accord wagon I might get real interested.

"akangl","February 2006"," In the next few months (after the Titan is paid off) I'm going to have to buy an SUV that seats at least 7. I'm looking at the Suburban, Armada, and then throwing a curve in there with the Honda Pilot. I've driven the Suburban (it was ok), the Armada (loved it), but not the Pilot.I want something that's going to hold its value so I don't lose anymore of my rearend like I did with the Titan. One thing I like about the Pilot is the gas mileage, right now my Titan is averaging 13 mpg, I need something better than that.So, opinions??  "
"andre1969","February 2006"," I've found that the third-row seat on most SUVs sucks for adults, no matter how big the SUV is. So even though the Pilot is considerably smaller than the Suburban and Armada, it might still be surprisingly roomy inside.One thing you might want to do though, is test out the Pilot with a full load and see how it performs. A lot of vehicles with small-ish engines can be great performers with a light load, but then when you start loading them to the gills, performance can often suffer worse than a bigger, torquier engine with mediocre horsepower. "
"nippononly","February 2006"," load up the Pilot and it will be fine powerwise. But the third row isn't much to talk about. Certainly if fuel economy and holding its value are two important attributes of what you buy, the Pilot is the best bet among that group. Not to mention, it would be the cheapest to buy wouldn't it? But it is smaller than them on the inside. You have to decide how much you need the space, and how much space you need. "
"qbrozen","February 2006"," Well, you're definitely throwing a curveball in there. The Suburban and Pilot are in entirely different classes. The closer comparison is the Trailblazer EXT to the Pilot. And, I can tell you from my first-hand comparison, although the Trailblazer seems much larger, the Pilot is roomier on the inside, especially in the 2nd and 3rd rows.If you are concerned about resale (which YOU should be), then there is only one choice. We bought our Pilot with nothing down on a 6-year note and we were able to trade it in just 2.5 years later for almost exactly what we owed. There isn't a chevy on the planet you could do that with.Oh, and we averaged 20-21 mpg along the way. "
"stickguy","February 2006"," I assume you still have a trailer to tow? If not, a minivan is vastly more sutied for regularly carrying 7 passengers. Even a Tahoe has less usable space (rear seat and definitely cargo area) than our Odyssey.A Suburban just seems like overkill for normal use, unless you plan to tow a large trailer.But, after sitting in one at the car show, the new GM interior is light years ahead of the old one!Also pass on the TB. I remember reading about them, and aren't they every bit as big as a Tahoe (length wise)? And in real world use, don't really get better mileage. "
"guss","February 2006"," a Toyota Highlander. I am not a fan of the looks but resale and gas mileage are way up there,especially if you get the Hybrid.It is smaller than the Pilot.If you are only putting kids back there who cares if knees in their chins will stunt their growth. "
"andre1969","February 2006"," yeah, IIRC the Trailblazer is longer than the Tahoe, at least the outgoing '06 model. I don't know about the new '07 though. The Tahoe was actually pretty small for a full-sized SUV: I think around 198"" long overall? The Durango's longer, too.Thing that sucks abou the TB though, is that to get a third-row seat you have to get that extended model, which has a wheelbase almost as long as a Suburban! Less overhang though, so overall it's still shorter. But it's also narrower inside, so you don't really get a whole lot of interior room.The '07 Tahoe/Yukon have a third-row seat option, so if you want a GM, you're no longer limited to the Suburban. "
"perna","February 2006"," If I lived down south where there was no chance of snow, needed room for 7, AND towing capability..I would buy a used full sized van (e.g. Ford E-150). No question. You can pick those things up for insanely cheap, they'll get the job done, and they'll run forever. Better yet, if you want to ride in style, get a 2-3 year old conversion van. You'll still pay a lot less than a new Burb, and it will be like riding around in a small apartment.I know full sized vans are, ah, less than sexy, but if money was tight that's what I'd do. I'd buy one at a price that I could pay off in two years, so instead of throwing money away on cars, you can do something that will result in positive equity; e.g., save up for a down payment on a house.

"andre1969","February 2006"," that the current Ford vans date back to 1975! IMO, they really don't look all that different, although they've been reskinned.The Chevy van is the newest design, AFAIK. The older style, which ran from the early 70's to mid-late 90's couldn't hold a big block in its engine bay, which was a strike against it in heavier applications. That's the main reason Dodge and Ford used to pretty much own the Class-C motorhome market back in the day, although Dodge started to lose their reign once they quit making big blocks.As for the Ram van, which they just quit making in the past couple of years, I think it also dates back to the early 1970's. They gave it a more modern looking nose around 1996 or so, but didn't update the sheetmetal to nearly the extent that Ford did. "
"akangl","February 2006"," The Pilot today and LOVED it. What a neat SUV, only thing I didn't like about it is a little bit of lag when I jumped on it, but the salesguy said that was just the engine switching back to 6 cylinders from 3. Big difference from the Titan, was very nimble and fun to drive. The Titan is fun in its own respect (I love my truck don't get me wrong), but its big and a major bear in parking garages or anywhere else for that matter.The price difference between 4WD and 2WD is less than $800 from what I could tell. I drove a 4WD EX-L, very nice, I really liked it.Legroom was a little tight, but the second row seats move forward to give the 3rd row extra room, was pretty cool.Anyway, I think if I do trade the Titan the Pilot is going to win out. Only drawback is it can't tow much, which is fine for a few years.BTW, I've had the Titan for 15 months and she has 39k on her. Still being a pretty good truck, can't complain really. Last I heard Zippy was doing fine, has around 53k on her, she is coming up on her second birthday in July, I miss my little car. "
"qbrozen","February 2006"," If you drove an AWD, the salesman is blowing smoke. Only the FWD model comes with cylinder deactivation.In any case, I'm surprised you felt any lag. I found ours quite peppy and responsive. But they have made some changes since our '03 model, so who knows. "
"stickguy","February 2006"," If you are used to a big V8, it sounds as if something is happening when you hit the gas, even if the Pilot is actually faster.I know that our Ody gets up and scoots. If there is ever a lag, it's when the trany is in a high gear for the speed, and needs to downshift to get any serious motivation going. hauls tookie on the highway though. "
"michaellno","February 2006"," Our VUE has the 3.5L Honda V6 with the 5 speed auto in it .. of course, since the VUE is only 3700 lbs versus the 4000+ pounds of the Ody or Pilot, it really gets up and goes!Maintains a pretty solid 80MPH on the interstate, but is blown around by crosswinds quite a bit. North of Fort Collins on I-25, it's like God's own wind tunnel. Goes from zero crosswind to a steady 35-40MPH. "
"michaellno","February 2006"," (I know, that often leads to trouble)Anyway, I was driving to work one morning and thought about how my current car ('03 Focus ZX5) is similar to the car I first bought when I moved to Colorado ('93 Honda Accord DX). I mean, they're both burgundy with a grey interior, both have stick shifts, similar engine size and power (2.2L and 125HP for the Honda, 2.0L and 130HP for the Focus).So, I decided to get onto Edmunds site and do a little comparison: Focus AccordCurb weight 2699 lbs 2778 lbsTorque 135 lb/ft 137 lb/ftEPA city/hwy 25/32 24/31Length 168.1"" 185.2""Wheelbase 103"" 107.1""Height 52.8"" 53.9""Front headroom 39.3"" 38.9""Rear legroom 37.6"" 34.3""Now, the Focus has A/C, ABS, power windows and locks; the Accord had none of that.Still, seems interesting that in 10 years, I could be driving two cars from different manufacturers that are so similar in many ways. "
"nippononly","February 2006"," makes me wonder (somewhat pessimistically) if there will be anything around the 2700-pound, 130 hp/tq mark available new in 2013...Cars are bulking up so fast, I dunno....maybe the smallest cars will still be that light then. "
"michaellno","February 2006"," yeah, that's what I was sort of thinking. 10 years ago, the Accord was considered a mid-size car, while the Focus is a compact.Smaller dimensions, same weight, same HP/torque, basically the same mileage.And, IIRC, pretty much the same price! I think the Accord was the last DX they had on the lot (the '94 redesign was just coming out) and they let me have it for around $14K. The Focus, OTOH, was fairly well loaded (we had to go to 4 different dealers to find a ZX5 with ABS) and stickered for something like $17-18K, but with the X-plan and rebates, we ended up paying around $14K for it as well.Doesn't sound like progress to me. Guess we'll have to see what happens in 7 more years! "
"nippononly","February 2006"," the Echo I just bought weighs just shy of 2100 pounds (curb weight), and I would bet anything you like I will never again buy a car lighter than this one. I like light cars.  "
"corvette","February 2006"," Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the Pilot and Ody are designed to put out slightly more power when using premium fuel (recommended for towing). Perhaps this could be the reason for a lag? I really like the way the Focus drives. The most demure thing about my Altima was the way the power steering was overboosted--the Focus' steering has a nice, firm feel. I wish they would bring over the current model from Europe, though. "
"michaellno","February 2006"," I've heard that Ford may bring over the redesigned Focus in '07 or '08 .. my understanding of why they didn't originally has to do with, what else, money.Since the Focus is Ford's bread and butter car in Europe, it made sense for them to get the new model as quickly as possible. Here in the US, the Focus is Ford's ""entry level"" model, and they are perfectly content to sell the old model (albeit with the new 2.3L engine) for a few more years as the tooling is already bought and paid for.I do agree with you about how the Focus drives -- quite a bit more fun than most compacts. However, it's not like we drove a lot of different cars and decided on the Focus. We got a letter from Ford indicating that they would pay off the remaining lease payments on our Explorer if we bought or leased another Ford product.Convinced wife that we could reduce the payment size and increase the gas mileage if we traded down - the other idea was that our daughter would be driving it. Spent a very long Saturday visiting 4 different dealerships before finding the car we ended up buying. Payment dropped from $580/mo to $320/mo with no cash out of pocket (gotta love X-plan and rebates!).27 months and 36,000 miles later the only things the car has required is oil changes and a new set of tires at 33K. "
"andre1969","February 2006"," I didn't realize the 1990-93 Accord was so lanky in the wheelbase! Maybe that's one reason I always liked that style...long-ish wheelbase, but not a lot of overhang made for a nicely balanced style. Made it look a little bigger than it really was. In contrast, the 1994-97 is only marginally shorter overall, and the wheelbase shorter by such a tiny amount the naked eye probably couldn't catch it, but just something about the style makes it seem so much stubbier to me. "
"bumpy","February 2006"," The early-90s Accord was the last of the ""low-line"" Hondas, which helped them look longer than they were. By contrast, the 94-97 Accord was basically an overgrown Civic with the higher beltline and trunklid to match. "
"michaellno","February 2006"," Yeah, I always liked the looks of the 90-93 Accord, too. Especially the 92 and 93 models, when they got away from the motorized belts and added an airbag.I actually owned two of those models -- one being a '92 LX that my first wife and I bought after she totalled her Protege and the second being the '93 DX, which I leased not long after moving to Denver. The first wife got the LX in the divorce - she kept it for a few years, then traded it in on a Dodge Ram pickup.While I was leasing the DX, I thought seriously about trading it in for a '95 or '96 LX Coupe. Dealer would have taken the DX in trade and the payments on the LX coupe would have been somewhere around $300/mo. At the time, I was financially strapped, so I passed. "
"andre1969","February 2006"," I also like the 1987-91 Camry, and the Mazda 626 that ran from around 1988-92. So if I ever get a strong desire to re-live the early 90's, I'm gonna have a hell of a time deciding which one to pick! "

"corvette","February 2006"," I like a well-designed climate control system. Some of the early auto climate systems were not very intelligent. If you started the car in the summer, the fan would immediately change to its highest setting, and begin blowing hot air in your face. If you started the car in the winter, the fan would do the same, only this time, it would blow cold air on you. The newer ones are a little more self-aware and slowly ramp up the fan speed after the car is started. "

"andre1969","February 2006"," my Intrepid's doors are supposed to lock automatically once the car hits a forward speed of 15 mph. And they're supposed to unlock...I know I should know this, considering I've had the car for 6 years and 114,000 miles now, but I can't remember if they unlock when you put it into Park, or when you turn it off?Anyway, there have been times when it would lock itself the moment you put it in gear. Or sometimes even when it's just sitting there, in Park, idling. When I used to deliver pizzas, I'd leave the car running. I worked a fairly safe neighborhood of mostly single-family homes, so usually I'd be right up in the driveway. I know, still not a good idea!  Well, there were a few times that the car would lock itself while it was sitting there, idling. I was just fortunate that every time it did it, my window was down. I'd usually have the driver's window down, especially at night, as I was looking for an exact house address. And those hot-bags would really heat up the car and fog the windows, so sometimes even in the winter I'd at least leave a rear window cracked.As for automatic climate control, my Grandma's '85 LeSabre had it. It was smart enough not to engage the fan until it was ready to give you the temperature that you wanted, but it had some other annoyances. For one, it only had two fan speeds you could select. Low or High. There was a middle button called ""Auto"", but when you pressed that you were at the mercy of what passed for a computer. The display was cool looking, a flat membrane surface that was almost futuristic looking. It had buttons on it that were flat, similar to those on an old Intellivision II hand controller. I know I'm digging into the past there, but that was the first thing that popped into my mind!Another thing that was annoying was how you set the temperature. It had a range that went from something like 60 degrees to 90 degrees. There was a button on the left that made it colder, and a button on the right that made it hotter. Where with the old fashioned type where you just slid a lever, you could go from full-cold to full-hot in a fraction of a second, here you had to sit and hold the button, and it would beep and a spot on the control would light up for every degree. I'd say it probably took about 30 seconds to get that sucker from full-cold to fulll-hot, or vice versa! "
"corvette","February 2006"," I've never experienced an auto-locking mishap, knock on wood. My Altima did not have automatic locks, but the manual lock for the door had very little resistance and was positioned right on top of the handle so that it was easy to bump (and lock the door) after pulling the handle to open the door. Several times, I inadvertently locked the driver's door on my way out, with the keys in the ignition--thankfully, the other doors were unlocked each time this happened. My grandparents' 1987 and 1990 Park Avenues had the same climate system--I remember the membrane control panel, and the two fan settings, but didn't remember that the system was smart enough not to fully spin up immediately. I also remember that it had an external thermometer, but you had to push a button on the membrane to view it (Ext Tmp or some other abomination [like Check Gages]). "

"andre1969","February 2006"," Wow, I'm definitely impressed! And even though I have a Mopar tendency, for some reason that '83 Impala 9C1 caught my eye! I've always liked those. Any memories of that one? Fond or otherwise? "
"andre1969","February 2006"," For some reason I always liked the Zephyr version better than the Fairmont. I think it's because the Zephyr always had the quad headlight setup that made it look more upscale, while a lot of the Fairmonts just had the single headlights and looked kinda cheap in comparison.They weren't terribly heavy cars, so even though the 200 only put out like 88-90 hp, I don't think they were as bad as it sounds. Ford would often at least give you a quicker axle ratio to make use of what little horsepower was there, whereas GM almost seemed to hold some of their engines back by putting in overly tall ratios. They had rack-and-pinion steering, too, which I guess was pretty progressive for that time in a domestic. "
"qbrozen","February 2006"," definitely, the steering was surprisingly light, even when sitting still. Certainly a HUGE difference between that and my CJ7 with the manual steering and 32""x12.5"" tires. THAT was a workout beyond belief.And, yes, I did feel it was a fairly quick car for what it was.

"racer63","February 2006"," $2800 off MSRP and destination. By rough numbers, this is deep into holdback, though there are rumors of $900 in trunk money going towards moving old stock. I honestly wasn't expecting to find any around. My preferred color can be found, however I'm going to have to travel a little out of state to NY or PA to get it, and that involves also dealing with NJMVC directly, and not getting the benefit of a new car 4 year initial inspection period that MVC delegates to dealers.I'm warming up on the idea of red. I had a ""dark black"" Jetta GLX with leather, and that interior was great for melting heinies on a hot sunny day. While silver outside would make this a little cooler, there still would be fried buns in July on those dark hydes.The only absolutely wouldn't buy it this time color was white. Especially with gray guts. It has been the color combo of the last 4 new purchases (95 Ranger, 99 Explorer, 00 Celica, 04 GMC 2500HD). The Ranger looked good in that color, but was bought for it's options-4.0, stick, 2wd, limited slip, sport suspension. The Exploder was actually dealer ordered to replace the Ranger, and none of the other color combos looked right. The Celica was intended to be an autocross car from day one, and refrigerator magnet material comes in white, so it was easy to place the sponsor and contingency decals on that, and it all blends right in. You gotta look good to go fast you know. The Monster Truck just happened to be a decent options content at a great price. It just was white over gray. :mad: Hence, I'm ready for something different. At least it won't clash with the red shutters on the house when parked in the driveway. :P This ultimately will come down to a late night discussion with the Mrs. once she gets home from work tonight, probably more to do with money than color.

Once I got it there, I filled it full of stop leak (radiator, trans, etc), and took the carb off and totally cleaned it up. New plugs and a little tuning, and it ran great (well, as great as the 200 inline ever could run). It was an auto, lemon yellow with a yellow interior. I put on some good ole' Walmart seat covers.

But any way, we are there and he keep selling and I keep saying no and then we get into a discussion about even if I cancel the plan early, I've paid more interest on the initial principal cost of a plan that I don't need in the first place. So he tells comes back with some gobbelty goop about ""interest is evenly distributed throughout the loan"". Initially I though he was just feeding me a line. I mean come on, I used to be a customer service/collections rep for an auto finance bank. I can explain simple interest to an illegal immigrant who barely speaks english. I tried it from several different directions to show if nothing else, that I knew what I was doing but this guy kept pushing the point.So then I ask him what the interest rate was. He quotes me a 9 1/2% figure. What a crackhead. My credit union has a 2.9% on a 36 month loan right now. I didn't expect them to beat that but I was still like ""no friggin' way""!!!. I take a glance over at his screen and see that not only is my interest rate jacked up but he has also somehow added about $2000 to my initial amount financed like he just KNEW he was gonna take me for some extra crap.Now i just bought my hoopty a week ago. I haven't even finish buying doo-dads off Ebay for it. So the last thing I really need is to buy another car right now. So I just got up and left. I told my salesman that his F&I guy just talked his way out of your sale.On my way home they called me back.

Ford/Lincoln/Mercury trucks, Dodge trucks, VW and Audi cars, Subarus, the QX56, ...By the 1990s, most cars had the main cooling intake from a slat under the bumper, making a large grille unnecessary for cooling purposes, so designers didn't include one. Now, they've gone back to using them as some sort of design statement. Yuck! "

At least, people who install one of those pipes with a cone filter on it dispense entirely with any sort of ducting or airflow direction for the intake. I've heard that an engine can seize with as little as a tablespoon of water, but I also know that slowly pouring water into the intake is a home remedy for removing carbon deposits. "
"michaellno","February 2006"," If I'm not mistaken, the EU has drafted new regulations regarding 'pedestrian friendly' automobies, which stipulate some minimum height requirement for the grille and hood (excuse me, ""bonnet"").I suspect that in the next year or so, we'll start to see those changes on cars that are sold both in Europe and the US -- I believe the new VW Passat is one of them.

"andre1969","February 2006"," the dealership that sold me my Intrepid now has this big brute on their used car lot.I'd really be tempted, except for a few things. First, it's a 1993, so it only has the 185 hp 350, and not the sweet 260 hp LT-1. Even with 185 hp, I think they'll still do 0-60 in around 9 seconds, which ain't bad for a big beast like this, but it ain't the wolf in old man's clothes that the '94-96 was. Second, it's priced awfully high for the mileage IMO: $5995 and 135,000 miles.I'd be tempted to go and offer them maybe $2500-3000 for it if I really had a need for it. I wonder if someone will snatch it up for close to asking price, and go a'pimpin' with it? "
"michaellno","February 2006"," Yeah, I can easily see someone putting 20"" chrome rims on that baby to trick it out.So, in general, is the 94-96 Roadmaster less desirable than the Impala SS from the same era, even though both had the LT-1 engine? "
"andre1969","February 2006"," yeah, supposedly the Roadmaster, Fleetwood, and LT-1 Caprice really aren't worth much, while the Impala SS seems like they're worth a fortune!I'd guess any of them would still be worth more than equivalent Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln big cars from that era, though. And I dunno if this is true or not, but I think the '94-96 Roadmaster Estate and Caprice wagons were actually a bit QUICKER from 0-60 than the Impala SS, because even though they were a bit heavier, they had a quicker rear-end that was intended more for towing, but also helped out with acceleration. I'm sure you could order that same rear on the Impala SS, though.Back in late 2004, I saw a '96 Roadmaster for sale at Carlisle, and I think it was marked down to around $4995 or $5995. It was really decked-out, though, with leather and a sunroof, and alloys. And I think it only had around 85,000 miles on it. At the time I was thinking about buying it and then selling my Intrepid, which had around 95,000 miles on it, but was just about paid off. This '96 Roadmaster was also a nice grayish green that I really like, similar to the ""Magnesium"" that Chrysler puts on the 300/Charger and other cars nowadays. "
"jefferyg","February 2006"," There's an older couple that goes to our church who have a Roadmaster from that era. Ed told me they get 27 mpg in the car. I personally just never liked the looks of the big Buicks and Chevys back in the early 90's. I do however like that color. The darker color makes it not seem quite so big and you don't see that plum/maroon color every day. One other observation is that a car that big just doesn't seem dressed without whitewall tires. $6K seems way steep. "
"andre1969","February 2006"," the EPA ratings on the LT-1 V-8 are something like 17/26. The older 185 hp TBI 350 is rated at 16/25, which really ain't bad for something that weighs over 2 tons and can hit 60 mph in about 9 seconds. In comparison, I think my Grandma's '85 LeSabre was rated around 17/24. And it weighed considerably less (despite being just as big, and actually a bit longer) and 0-60 was more like 12 seconds.I'm actually not that crazy about the looks of those big GM cars from the 90's, either, but they just seem to fit me better than the Ford products from that same era. And, well I just love big cars! IMO, the perfect big car would be one of GM's older, boxier styles from the 80's, but fitted with the more modern LT-1 350. "

"mark156","February 2006"," Perna, I thought the same as you about the Tribeca but it has grown on me and I actually like it.

I know the Tribeca has a prominent center grille but up close in the picture, the Porsche's grille is really big too.I like it when vehicles have a unique look that's why I bought a Land Rover LR3... I like the boxy style.I think the Tribeca will catch on much better than the Pontiac Aztek.... wow, I'm glad the pulled the plug on that one! :sick: Mark  "
"corvette","February 2006"," I really wanted to like the Tribeca. The snout on that thing is just atrocious, and the frog eyes don't help. It has a face only a mother could love. In 2007, they are removing some of the chrome from the grille, but the basic shape of the bumper/grille/headlights is still the same, so there's little improvement. They also changed the suspension to improve the ride and handling, but that's not enough to overcome the front end. I have no gripes with the styling of the rest of the car, just the front end. Perhaps some people can forgive that. The fundamentals of the Aztek had potential. Take a minivan, remove the third row, and put a big hatchback on it. I still think this idea would have worked if they got the styling right and built it with modern components instead of basing it on GM's antiquated minivan platform. Just before the death knell sounded, with all of the price reductions and rebates, the Aztek offered an amazing amount of features for the money, but most people wouldn't be caught dead driving one. I like the shape of the LR3. It's easy to identify a Land Rover on the road. "

"mark156","February 2006"," The thing that most people hate about the Tribeca is what I like and that's the grille on the front. If it didn't have that, it would look like every other SUV out there. I have never driven one but if I was in the market for a vehicle that size, it would be a consideration. I needed seating for 7 (comfortably) and that's why I picked the LR3. Also, I have tons of storage in the back when the seats are down. I have two timeshares that I go to in the summer and let me tell you, I am packed to the gills when I'm going to the unit. I have two weeks in one location and 4 weeks in another... so, I have my SUV loaded up!I'm averaging about 12 mpg in the city but I only have 3,300 miles on the new Land Rover. On the road, I'm getting close to 18 mpg. When the engine breaks-in, hopefully, I'll get the 14/18 that is posted on the sticker.

"steine13","February 2006"," This was a month ago; regarding a base 5sp Silverado pickup.kyfdx wrote: Base pickup? Bad idea... no one wants them... (I doubt you will, either.. once you get it). I beg to differ. It turns out that one of the local Chevy dealers had a 2004 GMC 4.3l 5sp reg cab SWB truck. And they were happy to let me have it overnight... it had 9,500 miles and looked to be in great shape. It also was bright red, a smoker's truck without cruise or a sliding window, and it had 20"" chrome wheels. Twen-Ty. Ugh.I loved the way it drove. Smooth, fast, decent stick; the engine a little coarse but heck, it's a truck. Very easy to drive smoothly, 2000 rpm at 70mph in 5th gear, and 3000 in 4th. A real ""overdrive"" transmission, and plenty of power anywhere; also the redline has moved above 5k; it used to be 4,500 rpm, which made the truck a real dog... I drove one a decade ago and hadn't seen one since. I loved both the driving position and the seats... just grippy enough to keep me from sliding around, which is really painful when driving a stick shift and have your left foot and right arm up in the air.The size would be just right for the missus to use for her antique shows. But it's no good. It took me five minutes to wrangle the darned thing into the garage. That's after I folded the pass side mirror. Then I had to squeeze between the rear corner of the truck and the garage door to get out... and I'm not that big. The stupid truck is simply too big to be a daily driver; and leaving it OUTSIDE the garage is not good because then we can't squeeze another car past it into the second parking spot. The price for a new one would be way right. Supplier pricing, rebate, GM Card; a $17k MSRP truck with AC and cruise and nothing else comes to $11,500 + TTL. And less if they choose to use one or six of those $250 coupons... less still if any ""conquest"" rebates apply... I think GM is getting truly desparate.-Mathias "

"andre1969","February 2006"," I'm the type that would go for a fairly basic full-sized truck. When it's time to finally retire my Silverado, I'd probably get a basic Sierra/Silverado. Standard cab, 8 foot bed. Only options I really want are an automatic tranny, a decent stereo with a cd player, and a sliding rear window. And I could probably deal with the V-6 (or whatever base engine is available by the time I'm in the market for a new truck). As it is, I'm sure the 4.3 they're using is more capable than the old 305-4bbl that's in my '85.I'm out in the boonies though, where I could turn the thing around in my yard if I wanted to. And if I ever felt the need to shelter it, I could just build another garage or carport. And I'm accustomed enough to my '85 Silverado, that I'm sure a newer one would handle better, and probably seem like a step up for me. Although, a new equivalent of my truck is about a foot longer, so it might seem more cumbersome in tight spaces. But then the new ones are also more rounded off and tapered in the front, where mine is more flat-faced. That does make a difference in tight maneuvering, as you actually have less bulk on the sides up front, ahead of the wheels.I've sat in all the small trucks, and there's not a single one that I like. Even the bigger ones, like the Dakota and Tacoma. The Dakota just feels bulky, but not roomy. And the Tacoma has an awkward driving position for me...too close to the door and offset from the steering wheel. And none of those little 'uns have much of a bed. Even if they have the payload capacity, they just don't have the bed space. "
"stickguy","February 2006"," Have you looked at a compact or mid size? I guess with your GM card, that would be a Canyon. An extra cab (2 door) would give a decent amount of room up front, and the bed size isn't going to be too much different than a standard cab full size, right?At least it should be narrow enough to fit into the garage, although maybe not that much shorter. "
"corvette","February 2006"," There seems to be plenty of room up front in a regular-cab Canyon/Colorado, but very little storage space. An extended-cab would help provide a makeshift ""trunk,"" and the ride would be better due to the longer wheelbase. Also, I think the blind spots are reduced on the extended-cab. However, the inline-five in those trucks makes Volvo's inline five sound like Lexus made it. "

IMO, if you are going cheap, go real cheap (say a '98 Sable for 4K). Otherwise, keep what you have and enjoy it for a long time. all MHO of course.I miss the Miata on occasion, but there were so few times that I could really use it right that it wasn't really worth having.

I thought the VUE was using some funny Opel V6. Last time I worked on one it had a silly euro cannister filter in the front of the motor instead of the little tiny spin on filter off to the passenger side like honda V6 models. "

Prior to that, they used the older V6.My '03 L300, OTOH, has that ""older"" 3.0L V6 that was sourced from Europe .. really odd 54 degree configuration .. this is the same engine that was found in the Cadillac Catera. In the Catera, the engine was tuned for 200HP, and in the Saturn it makes only 181HP.Still, plenty quick when you put your foot into it.I guess my bone of contention with your comment was that the RAV4 had ""30 to 40"" more HP than anything else .. with the VUE, it's only 17HP. Yeah, I know, nit-picky, but I'll defend my Saturns.(even though the L300 needs new brakes, front and rear, which will probably run north of $500) "
"andre1969","March 2006"," the old Saturn commercials for the L-series with the V-6. They showed some roadhog in a Honda Accord out on the desert, who started freaking out when the L overtook him and blew him away. Pretty cool commercial, I think it was actually a bit of a tribute to Spielberg's ""Duel"". The dude in the Accord even started freaking out when he couldn't shake the Saturn, just like Dennis Weaver did when he couldn't shake that semi.What V-6 did later versions of the L-300 use? Or did they use that Opel 3.0 right up until the end of the line? "
"michaellno","March 2006"," Nope, the 3.0L V6 was the only V6 used in the car, up until it was discontinued in 2005.Now, the Aura, which is slated to come out later this year, is supposed to have the same 3.6L V6 as the CTS. Not sure if there are plans for a smaller V6 or a 4-cylinder in lower trim levels.I vaguely remember the commercial .. when the L came out in 2000, what was the HP rating of the Accord V6? I believe it was 200, which meant that the Saturn was still down on ponies in comparison. "
"andre1969","March 2006"," the Accord's 3.0 had 200 hp, whereas the Saturn's 3.0 had either 192 or 197. I think the L might have been geared more aggressively though. Edmund's did a family car comparison test in 2000, and the Saturn ripped through 0-60 in 7.3 seconds, compared to 7.9 for the Accord. Quarter mile was quicker too.Truthfully, even nowadays when you look at road tests, an Accord or Altima V-6/automatic usually comes in around 7.2 seconds. Now someone like C&D or MT might trick it into the mid 6es, but for a ""real world"" figure, I usually see around 7.2. "

That thing is a really neat hauler. "
"michaellno","March 2006"," I'll agree with you on the ""people mover"" sentiment, but the two Saturns that we've bought new were the easiest buying process I've ever encountered. In addition, I felt that the value of the vehicle being purchased was top-notch, too.When the 2003 was bought, I looked at (what else) Accords, Camrys, Altimas and the VW Passat. I was looking for a V6, automatic, ABS, leather and sunroof - everything else was negotiable. The L300 priced out $2000 to $4000 less than anything else I looked at. Add in 0% financing and GM Supplier pricing, and it was an easy sale.Two years later, the wife wanted a small SUV. We drove the Santa Fe and Escape in addition to the VUE. Wife really liked the acceleration of the VUE (who wouldn't?) and the plastic panels were a plus, too.I know, I know - there are those who disdain the polymer panels because of the extra-wide gaps between them. When the Focus and VUE are parked next to each other in our garage the difference is quite apparent. However, it's nice to know that you won't ever get door dings. And, from what I've seen on older Saturns, they hold up real well over time.Anyway, count me as a Saturn fan. I'm not happy about the transition to steel, but I suppose that can't be helped. I'm very excited about the new Saturn products coming out in the future - Sky, Aura, Outlook, new ION (which I think will be a rebadged Opel/Vauxhall Astra). "
"corvette","March 2006"," The Aura is hot! I like the styling. The two-tone interior is really nice. I think they will offer a base four-cylinder version in addition to the V6. They introduced the Aura concept at the same time they introduced the Sky concept. While everyone was drooling over the Sky, I was wondering what the big fuss was over a badge-engineered Solstice, and I was looking at the Aura instead. "
"tifighter","March 2006"," If the new Ion was a rebadged Astra, that would be a huge step forward for Saturn. I rented one 2 months ago while in the UK and it was much better than I expected. It competes surprisingly well to the Golf, the European gold standard. And the grunt was respectable from the 1.8 I had. Saturn could be the strongest US lineup GM has if it was a bunch of rebadged Opel/Vauxhalls. It takes more then merely using the platform, GM... "
"steine13","March 2006"," Yeah, well...As far as ""rebadged Opels"", the General seems to not have a lucky hand in bringing it off. The Cadillac Catera never approached the Opel Omega in driving pleasure or in reliability; the Catera being one of the worst American cars in that regard, while the Omega is a fine vehicle by all accounts.Then there is the Saturn L series, which is not a big success either; a good friend has a 2003 he inherited from his Dad; the stupid thing has 20k or so on it and has already caused more trouble than his 100k '99 Solara. Electrical problems, doors locking on their own and only unlocking after many tries; transmission hunts on level ground while pulling a trailer; 26 mpg on the freeway, and that was the high-water-mark; power windows that will absolutely, positively, open the fifth or eight time the button is pushed... that sort of thing.But Ford can't do it either; the Focus was a sad hash until 2003, by which time the reputation of this fine car was completely trashed... and the Contour/Mondeo was no success either this side of the ocean.-Mathias "
"tifighter","March 2006"," Catera; good point. Weird one as that one was assembled in Germany.The others are good examples of subpar assembly, sub-contractors and execution rather than poor design. The Focus and Mondeo have very good reliability records in Europe from their launch year, but obviously not so much here. I guess when I think re-badged, I think RE-badged, not re-designed, re-formatted, re-spec'd and built here with re-sourced components. You will not find an Opel on the German market that you'd mistake for a Saturn L; seems more like a platform share then a rebadge.Plus, the Ion hasn't been exactly a home run. Last, can you imagine Mr. Goodwrench's face whenever he opens a hood and sees, argh, a OHC V6? The humanity...I'd guess that these car's faults, Catera included, have been done no favors by their local service departments. You'd have to be a pretty rangy mechanic to go from a DeVille with whitewalls to an Escalade with 'dubs' to the German 'Caddy that zigs' on a given day... :P "

I think they will have a winner if the driving dynamics (and quality) are there. Nice looking interior, very roomy, great flexibility, tons of neat little features, all at an attractive price. I was amazed at how roomy the back seat was. I sat behind myself, and had inches of kneeroom to spare, enough headroom to where a cowboy hat, and even tons of footroom under the front seat (the seats are elevated off the floor, almost like a minivan).You might not like the shape/styling (I do), but it really leads to a very functional interior.They also put other makers to shame with some of the goodies. 115v outlet, aux plug on the headunit face, flip up holder for a cell phone or ipod, the chiller box, etc.Anyway, it could give the Mazda3 a run for it's money if it drives right, and other than that, there really isn't anything quite like it on the market (I guess the Matrix/Vibe somewhat).

"qbrozen","March 2006"," For some reason, I always become blind to this particular problem ... I CAN'T lease. It always seems attractive to me, but then I remember that my insurance company (and maybe this is true of all insurance) makes me carry the high coverage of a lease on all of my vehicles, thereby adding about $1k-$1500 to my policy for the year. That pretty much offsets any monthly savings a lease provides, and then some.For my wife's Pacifica, Chrysler gave us the deal where we pay it like a lease, but it is not actually considered a ""lease"" and we don't have to change our insurance on it at all. Does anybody know the official name of this type of lending? I guess maybe its just called a balloon note, but with the option of giving the vehicle back after 3 years.Is this a common lending practice? Do all manufacturers offer this? Or will this be done away with entirely now that you can lease in New York again? "

"andre1969","March 2006"," back in 1998, it was what they called a ""Smart Buy"". 47 monthly payments, and then on the 48th payment he could either turn it back in or buy it for something like $5600. There was a mileage limit, too. 15,000 miles per year IIRC, or 60,000 miles total. He had around 90,000 miles on it. There was also a 10 cent per mile penalty for whatever you went over.So basically he had the choice of give them the car back, plus pay them $3000, and have nothing. And still need a car, and not have the credit to buy one. Or keep it and pay the $5600.He kept it and paid the $5600. And of course the tranny went out 2 months later!  Came out to just under $1200 for a used one with 55,000 miles on it, which has been troublefree since then.And that was over 3 1/2 years ago, and the car hasn't needed anything too major since then, although he had the timing belt done at 120K, which wasn't exactly cheap.

I sat behind and was disappointed to find no legroom. I am always stumped as to why there is no room under front seats in some cars. My feet would really like that. Its not always about knee room as much as how far can your feet can go. Front seats should always be elevated from floor pan so that rear passengers can stretch out.Other than that, I was expecting a quiet cabin but found lacking in sound insulation. Suspension was usual sporty nonsense rather than concentrating on absorbing bumps.

"corvette","March 2006"," People always concentrate on oil changes and forget completely about tranny flushes.I plan on following the book for both for the time being, because I suspect on many modern cars the electrics will go wonky long before the mechanicals wear out. If I still own my 325i beyond the 50,000 mile mark and plan to keep it, I might consider changing the manual transmission fluid and diff fluid. If you're a gentle driver and do mostly highway miles, there are tires today that will go 100,000 miles, and your brakes will probably outlast the tires. I don't think such components existed 20-30 years ago. As the life expectancies of these components have improved, so have fluids, filters, and the things they protect. "

What I'm faced with at this point is ... something with more utility or something more economical??When I do the math, economical doesn't seem to make sense. I mean, this is a 4th car, so, even in a best-case scenario, it might get driven half the time. When I calculate that out, at $3 per gallon (which gas isn't even close to right now), I save a whopping $30 a month by getting 35 mpg vs 25 mpg. SO why get an overpriced, cramped Civic to save $30 a month?So the other thought - utility - seems to be the more practical choice. Maybe a nice late 90s Dodge Dakota extended cab. I had a '97 and loved it. But the 14 mpg and poor handling made it completely impractical as a primary car .... so maybe as a 4th car ....???Anyway, I'm thinking in the $5500 range ...the biggest key is going to be something high on reliability and low on maintenance (hence, once again, a Civic makes sense here). The Volvo is just demanding too much time for the amount we drive it now (although, i could contemplate the idea that now so much is fixed ... will it be good to me for a while?). "

Two examples are the Fusion SE for $219/mo and the Mariner 4x4 V6 Luxury for $279/mo.If (and that's a pretty big if) they are equipped the way I would want it, that seems like a screaming deal. Since the daughter going off to college would come nowhere close to the annual mileage allotment, I could easily shave a couple of hundred bucks off my vehicle budget each month.Granted, I'd have to figure out what to do at the end of the lease, but my thinking is that by that time, the kid would be 21 and could buy her own car (with Mommy and me co-signing, if necessary).

That gave way to a '76 GMC 3/4 ton crew cab, which then ultimately got replaced by the Silverado once Granddad decided not to do anymore camping and that hotels were easier. The Silverado wasn't strong enough to hold his camper safely, although he did do a test fit once, and drove it around the block. Originally the Silverado was just going to be something smaller and more maneuverable for Granddad to drive around, and he was going to keep the big '76 for camping.

Especially on a hot summer day after a few good, hard stops!Well, my buddy goofed up immediately at the beginning of the test! When you do that, the cop that goes out with you takes over the driving and has to take the car the whole rest of the way through the course. When they got back, the cop told me that my car was idling way too fast. My buddy also told me that the cop was griping about my car under his breath the whole way through the test, muttering about no power steering, too much power (that fast idle would make it almost pounce like an angry jungle cat when you let off the brake), etc etc.My friend then tried to borrow his cousin's '85 Lynx to take the test in, which I thought would be a cakewalk, but it had a huge crack in the windshield so they wouldn't let him take the test.

"andre1969","March 2006"," for what they were at the time, I kinda like the '74 GTO as well. It was just a sad end to the musclecar era, and seemed so anticlimatic compared to what had come before. And with 200 hp in a body that weighed maybe 3500 pounds, it was pretty decent for the time. A Duster/Dart Sport 360 was a few hundred pounds lighter and had 245 hp, and could probably beat it, but by that time there really wasn't a whole lot left around. You could still get a 280 hp 440 in a Charger that year, but I'd imagine the extra weight of the larger car and the big block would offset any performance advantage. I think you could still get a 310 hp 455 in the Firebird though. Using the old gross rating that would probbably be around 400, so I'm sure that could be pretty exciting. "
"akangl","March 2006"," I'm seeing cars kept for 76 months, 28 months, 31 years!!!!Let's see, in the fleet here in Alaska, Zippy is at 20 months, the Titan is at 16 months, and the Ram is at 28 months. Heck, even the travel trailer is over a year now. "
"andre1969","March 2006"," I keep trying to talk myself into a new car, but then I find more compelling reasons to talk myself out of it! Mainly financial. Since I made the last payment on my Intrepid (11/04), I've had to put maybe $520 into it, all of it maintenance (oil changes, filters, battery, brakes, etc) or stupidity-related (stripped drain plug).The car payment itself was $347.66. So the way I look at it, since November 2004, the car has only cost me 1 1/2 payments!  And I'm sure that any new car on my list would run more than $347.66 per month unless I financed it for a long time, or put a big down payment on it. The best rate I found is at my credit union, which is 5.4%. To come in at around that $347.66 payment for 5 years, the most I'd be able to borrow is around $18,300. I don't think that would get me much of a Charger.  "

"michaellno","March 2006"," I hear ya. After dropping a ton of money to completely redo the brakes on our L300 after 44,000 miles, my thinking on European cars has taken a drastic turn (remember, the L has quite a number of Euro-sourced components, including the engine and, apparently, the brakes).I think I'm much more inclined to get something that won't cost the proverbial arm and a leg in maintenance costs the next time around. That, or pop for an extended warranty.(question: would said warranty have covered the brakes? I know the pads are a wearable item and probably not covered, but I wonder about the rotors and calipers?)Perhaps I should look at getting andre's DeSoto? "
"andre1969","March 2006"," by saying anything, but I was bracing for my Intrepid to start giving me fits around the 70-90,000 mile mark, which is where I've heard a common problem time is for cars. And as I recall, the cars that my family has bought new in the past, and had problems with, tended to crop up around then.But it really didn't happen. I had a few minor fits around 50,000 miles, like a leaky thermostat housing, door seals starting to shrink, etc. Then after that there was really nothing.Around 85,000 miles I had the coolant flushed and the belts replaced, and soon after that the oil pressure light started coming on. There was a TSB to fix that though. The wiring to the sensor would overheat at idle and make it give a false reading, but there was nothing actually wrong with the oil pressure. Then, around 97,000 miles I replaced my front pads and rotors myself, for about $83.Had the repair shop do my back brakes, check/adjust the parking brake, and also check my handiwork up front around the 102,000 mile mark. And that's been about it. I just had it in the shop last week, around the 114,700 mark, to have them change the oil, rotate the tires, check the brakes, etc. Stuff I'd normally do, but just felt like being lazy about.I don't think brake rotors would be covered in a warranty, because usually they go bad because of the rotors, or over-tightened lugs, etc. I'd think a caliper would be covered, though.As for my DeSoto, I think its brakes are actually MORE complicated than modern brakes. It had 4-wheel drums all around, but you need a special wheel puller tool to get the back drums off. And the car has something called ""Total Contact Braking"", which gives it two cylinders per wheel up front, instead of the usual one. That allows the shoes to press out more evenly on the drum, but adds more complexity as well. At least with modern brakes, replacing the pads and even the rotors is usually a pretty easy job. I've heard that the back brakes on my Intrepid are tricky though, so I've just left them to the mechanic. "

If the transmission's about to go, I wonder if the computer would be ""smart"" enough to trigger the check engine light?I know on my buddy's Tracker, when the torque converter refused to lock up (usually happens around 45 mph) it would trigger the check engine light.The check engine light/service engine soon light is one problem I've never had with my Intrepid, although I did have the oil pressure light come on back in 2003 (turned out there was a TSB on it and it was an electrical problem, not a real oil pressure problem.

"akangl","March 2006"," When I said the Titan would be paid for in a few months that was if things stayed the same, with me in Texas. Long story, but that's the only way I could have kept the truck was if we bought the lease out and paid it off.The Dodge will be paid off in December and Zippy is hopefully going to be sold in the next few months since its not needed anymore (and contributes to the $4200/year in insurance we pay). That just leaves the Titan, who's future is up in the air, obviously going to either have to buy it (take out a loan in december for 24 months) or trade it in. We aren't too bad off in it anymore (he made extra payments while I was gone) and will be right side up if we buy it or trade it this fall/winter.The only thing we are seriously buried in is the travel trailer and since we didn't put a big down payment its the nature of the beast. Right now we have 5 trailers.......3 are paid for (car hauler, utility trailer, and horse trailer), one is upside down (travel trailer), and one we have about 50% equity in (dump trailer). Then we have the 3 vehicles......our yard is really too small for all this. With 4 trailers (my horse trailer is being fixed right now) and 3 vehicles in the yard its truely creative parking, don't know what we will do with the horse trailer when it comes home.Right now I'm looking at cutting Zippy and the horse trailer from the herd, after that I don't know, but I do know NO NEW ADDITIONS until at least next winter!!!

"gee35coupe","March 2006"," I seriously doubt you are right side up in the Titan. Considering its mileage and the fact that the contract is a lease, the chances of being right side up in that thing is pretty slim. 30 months worth of $620-ish payments plus residual puts that thing not only upside down but you might as well put tires on the roof.Extra payments on a lease? Why would you pay extra rent? Many better places to put money. "
"nippononly","March 2006"," well, I have never leased, but wouldn't extra payments go towards the total contract, so that in effect you could reach the point where there were no more payments to make? Of course, that's still not ""right side up"" if the residual is way more than what it's worth with all the extra miles being put on it. Ultimately, I have never leased because I don't want to be 18 months into a lease and dying for a new car, but also because I drive more miles than would ever be written into any lease. The miles will kill you in a lease. HOWEVER, I would imagine if you pay off a 4-year lease in 18 months, then the truck would still be worth at least the residual, and you could finance that and buy the truck from the leasing company. I tend to spend a lot of money on the revolving door of car payments, although I am careful to never get close to ""in over my head"". If I can't be ""right side up"" in a car within a year, I don't sign on the dotted line. My current pair have only been with me 7 months and 2 months, so despite my constantly restless eyes, I won't be looking again this year! :-P "

They build interference engines, less value placed on rust protection, less value placed on ride or noise. But the slickest 4cylinders anywhere, fantastic transmissions -- stick or not -- and great handling. They may never overtake Toyota in volume, but they have built a tremendous brand image.

Yeah, right .. configured with those options, I was looking at somewhere around $28K for the Altima.Camry SE? IIRC, they didn't come with leather and/or sunroof together. That, and the wife took one look at it from the outside and said ""Grampa car"" (or words to that effect).Accord? The latest body style had just been released when I was in the market, so discounts were few and far between. And, for some reason that remains unknown to me to this day, the wife has this thing against Hondas.The only other car I looked at seriously was the VW Passat, which I loved but didn't have enough 'nooks and crannies' to store stuff in. That, and it too was in the high 20's when optioned with a V6, auto, leather and a sunroof.The L-series cost me around $24K and I got 0% financing on top of it, so in the end it was a pretty easy decision. The wife told me, however, just a couple of weeks ago, that she was leaning towards the Altima.Sigh.... "
"andre1969","March 2006"," I wonder if it was an Accord LX V-6 I spec'ed instead of an EX? I just tried to do an EX, and the TMV came in at $26K!I used to think the Camry was pretty dowdy, but for some reason I think that '05 or so restyle really breathed some new life into it, especially the SE model. I know it was just a minor restyle, but it was enough to interest me in it.I've set a goal for myself, but it's one that's not going to make me popular in this forum. But here it is...NO MORE CARS, new or otherwise, until at least April 2008 (my 38th birthday). "
"corvette","March 2006"," NO MORE CARS, new or otherwise, until at least April 2008 (my 38th birthday).How many miles will your Intrepid have on it by then? "
"andre1969","March 2006"," How many miles will your Intrepid have on it by then?Well, it just hit 115,000 the other day. I'm only averaging around 1,000 miles per month these days, so I'd say it would probably be pushing 140,000 miles by then.My uncle has been driving it these past few days though, since his Corolla's in the body shop and his truck is in the tranny shop. He's putting about 130 miles per DAY on it!I figure though, that even if something catastrophic happened to it, I could fall back on my older cars. Drive the convertible and LeMans on nice days, the NYer on not-so-nice days, the pickup in bad weather (it actually does pretty well in the snow), and just rent a car if I ever went on a really long trip. "
"guss","March 2006"," they produced the L-series in the Wilmington plantI stand corrected.I will never make a statement(at least not in writing)that I will not buy another car for 2 more years. I think with the last purchase I am done for awhile. Even told my wife so. She just rolled her eyes, but did not ask me to define awhile.I am hoping to make it 4 years, but that has never been done by me before. "
"andre1969","March 2006"," between buying cars was about 2 1/2 years. That happened twice. My Mom gave me her old 1980 Malibu in Febuary 1987, and I got a 1969 Dart GT in September 1989.The second time was fairly recently. My Mom sold me my Granddad's old '85 Silverado back in September 2002, and I bought my '76 LeMans in April of 2005.But, even if I can't hold out another ~2 years, I'm not going to cry over it. It's a goal, sure. But I've been known to be an underachiever. :shades: "
"michaellno","March 2006"," Was talking with the wife the other day about (what else) our transportation issues. After dropping so much money into the L-series for brakes, I think we're in good shape, though I do think about always having cars in warranty, which may mean a return to the lease cycle. OTOH, being so close to having fewer car payments (currently 3) is quite an incentive. That, plus having only 15 more child support payments, means that the family cash flow ought to improve substantially in the next 18-24 months.Having said all that, there is still the chance that the L will get sold this summer.

"stickguy","March 2006"," OK, not really bad news. But, I just paid to extend my XM subscription in the Accord, since the free trial from Honda runs out next week. Guess I have to keep it until at least the end of the year!I'm also looking forward to going back to no payments. We were payment free for a couple of years, until we got the Odyssey, which has about 21 payments left, but we will probably pay off by summertime. Then, all former car money can go into the college fund!having a HS student certainly puts a damper on the car buying hobby. THe current plan is to keep the 2 '05 Hondas at least until the 1st one graduates (7 years from now, if he stays on the 4 year plan, and that's all I plan to pay for!)Then we get a 1 year reprieve until number 2 goes. I figure by then the van will be ready to be repalced (it will be 8 years old, and IMO minivans don't age particulary well).I may have the Accord for 12 more years at this rate!

I showed the ad to my niece and her husband as they could use cheap transportation since they have just bought a new house, etc. They have a '02 Subaru wagon and a '94 Civic and BMW motorcycle.That lease deal seems WAY to good to pass up.

"corvette","March 2006"," Since we were discussing the Caliber a while back. It's just infuriating to me when manufacturers dumb down cars for the US market, or upfit them for the Euro market. Ford does it with the Focus, Honda does it with the Civic, and apparently Dodge is doing it with the Caliber. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/main.jhtml?xml=/motoring/2006/03/17/mfdodg18- .xml&sSheet=/motoring/2006/03/18/ixmot.htmlExcerpt:""On US suspension and tyres there was a trembling sensation to the ride and a feeling that the vehicle was clambering over bumps rather than riding them.The steering was lifeless, and my few attempts to put the model through its paces were met with an almost total lack of front-end bite and marked reluctance to turn into corners. The brakes do stop the car eventually, but on first pushing the pedal you'd be forgiven for thinking that the pads were made of cardboard.European cars will come with different steering, brakes, wheels, tyres, suspension and anti-roll stiffness."" "
"stickguy","March 2006"," that's because many Euro buyers actually care about this stuff. Too many US buyers just want it as cheap as possible, but with plenty of cupholders.Hey, the money for the mini fridge in the dash had to come from someplace! "

"corvette","March 2006"," No argument there, and mini-fridge or not, I'd rather pay a premium in order to get a more responsive driving experience, designed by the same people who engineered the car, instead of having a aftermarket band-aids as my only option.

"andre1969","March 2006"," I wouldn't have a problem with a 90's truck, but I guess the reason that '83 caught my eye is because it's similar to what I have.

Only thing is, once I start looking to stuff older than, say, a '72 Dodge or a '73 GM, I just don't like the driving position of those older trucks. "

"andre1969","March 2006"," hmmm, that $13.8K DOES sound tempting! Although I'd want one with an automatic, so that might bring it up to around $14.5K? And once it's all said and done, probably something like $15.2-15.5K out the door?If I put $2000 down, my payments would be something like $250 monthly for 5 years. Not bad. Except that, even with the $1100 I just sunk into my truck, it's averaged out to about $112 monthly over the time I've had it. Including the purchase price, maintenance, tags, title, registration, repairs, etc.Then there's insurance. My truck right now costs $293 per year to insure. I have no idea what a new one would run, with full coverage. My Intrepid, with full coverage, is around $520, but I'd guess a brand-new truck would be more than that.Eventually though, I have thought about maybe condensing down. Replace the Intrepid AND the Silverado with one new truck. But not until I'm 38 :shades:**Edit: basically, the main reason I'm holding off until 38 and acting so stingy, car-wise, is because I'm trying to focus on getting an HELOC paid down.

"michaellno","March 2006"," After dropping the proverbial boatload of money to redo the brakes in the daughter's L, she is now telling me about the electronic gremlins that have invaded.For the past month, she's seen random warning lights on the dash light up. Nothing real major, I figure.Well, last night they got a bit nasty. While driving to work, she reported that the gas gauge went from 3/4 tank to empty and back, the speedometer went from 25MPH to 0 and back and more warning lights are displaying.After she got home from work, I took the car out for a drive to see if I could witness any of these 'anomalies'. Nope - not an idiot light shown, nothing.Today, wife and daughter are out together and wife sees the idiot lights go off - specifically, the ""ABS"" light and one other.I have an appointment to take the car into the dealer next week to have it looked at. My fear is that the BCM is hosed and needs to be replaced - this is common with the L-series, according to another board I frequent.So, on top of the monthly payment we're making, we're now starting to invest major money into this car, which leads both my wife and I to believe that perhaps a new car might be in order.Her perspective is to reduce the monthly nut - currently $464 - to something less. Has to be a new car with an auto, keyless remote and ABS at a minimum.Coincidentally, I get my annual bonus next week, so there is a bit of money to put down, on top of the trade.Guess we'll see what happens at the dealer next week.

"steine13","March 2006","  The current generation is getting very long in the tooth and definitely needs updating...As compared to what?The Focus was and is a fine car.The only thing it needs -- or needed -- is improvement in reliability.According to CU, these cars have been at least OK since the '03 model year. For $10, I'd get it if I needed a commuter car. I prefer a stick anyway, I don't mind crank windows, and money always talks.One thing we often forget when looking at cars and car reports and C&D articles is this:In the real world, it doesn't matter whether the turn-in is smoother on the Civic or the Corolla. It doesn't matter whether the road holding is .05 g more or less. What really matters is a certain amount of comfort and quiet, an interior that does not disintegrate around you (GM? VW?), and a car that's in your driveway more than in the shop.I used to have a '93 Corolla from '01 to '03... fine car. My biggest gripe was a vibration that made a funny noise from the door at idle. At 180k, I could live with it. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a fine automobile as much as the next guy, but a cheapo Ford Focus is going to be way ahead of any Neon... Cavalier... ION... and probably, the Cobalt, too... But for someone on a tight budget who'd rather have a new car than a used one, it could be a steal!

With the new Sentra, Corolla, Elentra & 3 just around the corner, I think the only way Ford can move the Focus is with such steep discounts.I'm just very curious to see what Ford comes out with next...will it even be called the Focus? The new Caliber seems nice on paper and some magsazines have said that it's like night & day compared to the Neon. Should be interesting to see how Ford responds.

"tifighter","March 2006"," Hmm, something itches...time to consult the CCBA gang.New Mazda5 or used 05 Legacy Wagon 2.5i? Both sticks, both silver. Both about the same gas mileage and have 6 airbags.The Mazda is a pretty slick package with a super versatile interior. Slightly shorter length is easier to park in my underground garage. Looking at the touring model with all the bells and whistles, incl. a sunroof which I like. Have had a great experience with our Protege5 but need some more room for ski trips. Looks like a minivan til you walk up to it and can see clean over it; same height as a Forester but with sliding doors. Ski trips means snow, hence the Legacy. AWD is great. Longer, but has a nice interior on the new models. Basic model means no sunroof. A little cheaper than the Mazda, and a manual Legacy wagon isn't easy to find. 24k miles.Still deciding; would be used mainly for everyday stuff, but in the winter would do ski trips once a week for 3 months. FWD with winter tires should be okay, i'd think, but there is no mpg penalty with the Legacy's awd. What would you buy? "

"nyccarguy","March 2006"," speaking of enticing deals...I saw an ad in the paper today to lease EITHER a 2006 Mercedes-Benz R350 (MSRP $51,475) OR a 2006 Mercedes-Benz CLK 350 (MSRP $50,100) for 27 months(12K per year) for $399 per month + Tax with ZERO cap cost reduction.I'm a big BMW fan and a die hard stick shift driver, but I might be able to live with a CLK for a little over 2 years. With my wife being 3+ months pregnant, the last thing we need is another Coupe. Although it does have lots more room inside (with easier rear seat access) than my 2001 Prelude Type SH.

"tifighter","March 2006"," Hi Mathias-I was waiting for you to come in for the Subaru after what you said about them in the Trade in Values forum. Any luck finding a stick yet?It's true; I am more interested in the cargo than people space, and the third row in the 5 would be almost always folded down. I sort of like that it is NOT a Subaru though! When I am in Europe, I have had Zafiras or Tourans to drive and I've come to appreciate the versatility of the microvan idea. Mazda is the first to bring one to the US, and sometimes I feel like putting my money where my mouth is and support it. Would be my first new car, and new has some benefits. If only it had an AWD option...Here in Seattle, Subies are everywhere. In my lot at work, I am the only non-Subaru for 7 spaces in a row! That said, there is a reason people like them. The Forester is a good car and its the right size, but after looking at them, I can't get EXCITED about them. The turbo XT is a different story, but so is the price.  The 05+ Legacy is a nice car though; first Subaru I liked the looks of in a while. Especially the non-Outback. With a stick. Just trying to decide if its too big and how much I will miss a sunroof.

"tifighter","March 2006"," Oh yeah, and I did find a silver 05 Forester X AT with 23k on it locally for 16k. That seems like a VERY fair price, but man, the interior is a two-tone gray/teal color that is just bad. Really bad. Like circa-1993 Geo bad...  "

"guss","March 2006"," I looked at all of these and chose the Escape.My needs may be a little different than yours though. Being 6'6"" head and legroom were a priority. That knocked the Subie's out right away.The Honda CR-V fit but ,I could not find one in my budget(under $14k with less than 40k miles.)I think that is a sweet spot in the market for Honda sellers.I liked the RAv4 alot, but the back seats were too narrow to get three kids cars seats back there. That was my second criteria.The Liberty had the best deals used, and there are a ton of them around. They must have alot of lease deals going 2 and 3 years ago. My problem was a sight line issue with them. The roof line came too low and all I ended up looking at was the sun visor. The liberty was my second choice because they had the best value. Not a deal killer was the swing away rear tire,that makes loading things awkward.So far I really like my Escape, the ride is a little harsh but not untolerable. Consumer reports also gave it good marks from '03 on up.I think I will be hanging on to it for awhile.At least until the new Ford Edge comes out. "
"michaellno","March 2006"," Well, there really is no update. The plan (at the moment) is to take the Saturn into the shop tomorrow and see what exactly is wrong with it before deciding to do anything.To address specific comments made in earlier posts:--> I am eligible for supplier discounts for all the US manufacturers - GM, Ford and DC (and all the related brands that they own, I would presume). This is why I have leaned towards domestic nameplates for my recent purchases (2 Saturns and 1 Ford).--> Yes, the L is the Saturn L-series, cousin to the Opel/Vauxhall Vectra and the late and unlameted Cadillac Catera. Mine is a V6, fully loaded - automatic climate control, leather, power and heated seats, sunroof, chrome wheels, ABS/TC. Which I bought for thousands less than a comparable Altima, Accord, Camry and Passat - and got 0% financing as well.--> I happen to also have a Ford Focus, and believe it to be a great car .. in the 37,000 miles that we've driven it, it's only needed regular maintenance and a set of new tires. No recalls or issues at all.--> Some of the reasons I am leaning towards an ION as a replacement for the L instead of the Cobalt are:1) the polymer panels on the ION (great dent resistance - the L and the wife's VUE look great compared to the Focus when it comes to door dings - or the lack thereof).2) the belief (perhaps mistaken) that I will get a higher trade in value of the my current Saturn if I trade it in at a Saturn dealer. No, I haven't talked trade value with a Chevy (or any other manufacturers) dealer to prove or disprove this theory.3) Saturn is offering 0% financing for 36 or 48 months on the ION at the moment, along with a $500 rebate.4) My understanding is that the '06 ION has all the rolling updates to the platform that the Cobalt was originally introduced with, so I'm not sure there is as much of a difference between the two models as others might believe.Anyway, I do appreciate the feedback - both positive and negative - that you all have provided. The jury is still out on what will happen.The auto show is in Denver this week and one of the dealers I spoke with indicated that there is and extra $500 in ""auto show"" cash if we buy before the end of the month.BTW, there is about a $500 difference between the price of the ION 2 optioned the way we want and the ION 3 optioned the same way - basically, the only difference is that the 16"" alloy wheels are standard on the 3. Turns out it's much easier to find a 3 with ABS than a 2 with all the options we want (ABS, AC, preferred pkg). "
"british_rover","March 2006"," Yeah I have seen those lease deals and I have had a couple of customers come in and mention them so I guess they are legit.I would guess with tax and fees that monthly payment will get up close to 500 dollars a month though. Start up fees for that kind of lease are probably a couple of thousand.I have had people cross shopping both the LR3/Range Rover Sport against the R-Class and basicly saying, ""Why should I buy your car that is going to lease for between $800-$1,200 a month when I can lease the Benz for less then $500?My response, ""Well if you want an over priced Minivan then go right ahead and you need to compare apples to apples not apples to kumquats since my Land Rovers are between $5,000 and $11,000 more expensive then the Benz.

I have seating for seven and the R500 can only seat 6 with it's 2+2+2 arrangement.

"akangl","March 2006"," Hoping to not have to buy new, just want something to get me by a couple years until I can swing a new Honda Pilot. The Dodge and Titan are leaving in June, was going to just make do with Zippy, but with 2 kids its very hard in a 2 door car. Soooo, I figured I could trade Zippy and get a small used SUV to squeak me by.By looking at the prices I can pick up a decent used Escape for $15k, but I'm concerned about reliability and resale. Might have to look for a used Outback or Legacy, I will take a look at the Forester too. I'm hoping I don't have to spend over $15k, actually looked at some older SUV's in the $10k range but they are pretty miled up. I hadn't planned on letting the Titan go, but its a way to get out of the lease (am already way over the lease miles), trade 2 trucks for 1, and get a crew cab 1-ton that can combine the Titan and Dodge. That way our car insurance goes down as well as mantainace on that 3rd vehicle. Probably not buying until June so I've got time, will wait until the new truck gets in (he's ordering it).The yard is clearing out fast, sold the horse trailer on Friday, the snowmobile yesterday, just have the 18' car hauler left to go and we have some room in the yard! 5 trailers, a snowmobile that nobody rode for years, and 3 vehicles was a wee bit tight.

"michaellno","March 2006"," Nah, I don't look at it as justification, just some background in the family decision making process.I know I get knocked for my attitude about Saturns.

And, the wife really likes the purchase process that we've had.Anyway, the car goes into the shop tomorrow. I've actually seen the problem first hand now, so I've got my fingers crossed that it's something simple like a loose connection or a bad battery - both of these are possible causes of the problems we've been seeing.After getting the diagnosis and cost estimate to repair, the wife and I will make a decision about what direction to go. "
"michaellno","March 2006"," I suppose it depends upon how long you plan on keeping the new ride, and how many miles you are going to put onto it.On the surface, an '03 model year anything with over 50K on it would seem excessive (the '03 L that I bought in 11/2002 has 45K on it), but this is Alaska, where ""average"" mileage per year takes on a whole new meaning.It seems hard to justify $22-24K on a 2 or 3 year old car, but again, your neck of the woods seems to do strange things to resale values.From a mechanical standpoint, I would think that you will get an easy 120-150K out of that 3.5L V6 - heck, I hope so, as that's the same engine that is in my wife's VUE!Bottom line, if you feel comfortable with the car, go for it.

It's fun to drive, it is unbeatable in winter slop, and it's a good value. It's not perfect -- no stability control (not even on the 06s), and yes, the backseat is smallish (although I think people get a little dramatic about this sort of thing sometimes). But all in all, it's been a pleasure.In my experience (just about two calendar years and 24K mi.), the AWD mileage penalty is pronounced in stop-and-go city driving and minimal in highway/rural settings. We live in New York City, and if we go an entire tank driving exclusively in the city, I've registered as low as 15 mpg (EPA is 21, IIRC). Exclusively highway, I've gotten just over 30 mpg on a couple tankfuls. And in light suburban/mixed/rural types of driving, I've gotten around 26-28 (EPA is 28).There is a ""real-world mileage"" thread in the Subaru discussions, too, in case I haven't presented a scenario that matches your daily driving habits here.

"davesbrew","March 2006"," I'm having a very hard time deciding. Any thoughts on the smartest buy? Residual value and reliability are the top priorities. Also, I just got a fairly upscale job and my 94 altima w/ 194k and hail damage is frankly a little of an embarrassment, so hence the new (to me) car.Also, I drive new places frequently, so nav is a plus.I found the following at a neighborhood small lot that I drive by regularly.The contenders: 2001 Lexus GS430 with nav(the only one in this bunch) and chrome wheels and 44k mi. This was a 3 owner + repo car. Decent condition, but does look a little more worn than the others. Price about 21k2002 Lexus ES300 with only 19k miles and chrome. No idea how many owners, but looks sharp. The extremely low miles make me worry a bit about odometer rollback, so before any purchase is made i'll be looking for signs and getting carfax report. Price about 21k2004 Acura TL with 31k miles. This one looks very nice inside, and I have to say, I'm intrigued by the standard bluetooth and dvd-audio. I'm not positive, but think this might be the only one with any warranty. Price about 23-24kNote all prices haven't been dickered down yet, but for starting prices strike me as very fair.Any thoughts? Before I saw these, I was considering a new civic or mazda3, as I am a young feller, and 20k is a lot of money to me but saw these for about the same price and am strongly considering them. Just have no clue which is a better bet.Thanks much for any input. "
"british_rover","March 2006"," I would stay away from the GS430 sounds like trouble. Three owners does not necessarily scare me off but three owners in 5 years and a repo does.The Lexus actually does have warranty left since Lexus offers a 6 year 70,000 miles powertrain warranty in additon to the base 4 year 50,000 miles full warranty.If you do not need the extra room that the ES offers I would go with the TL it is a much better drivers car. I recently sold a 2004 TL with automatic and navigation for 22,000 and it had 53,000 miles so 23-24 is a very fair price. "

Will probably have a clearer picture then.Michaell-- I usually feel the same way as you, which is why I've driven my altima into the ground. I'm now surrounded by folks who all have the luxury nameplates (as well as nicer suits drycleaned more frequently than mine), and am starting to feel a bit of peer pressure. Also, I'm currently unable to drive clients anywhere. Chances are I'll have this next car a good long while, so as loaded and comfortable as possible would be nice, as I'm more of a chronic car shopper than buyer. So it sounds like you would recommend loading up a new economy car (civic/mazda3 or Accord) over getting a few year old luxo-car. (Even over the 04 TL?) "

"nippononly","March 2006"," I was gonna say go Mazda3 until you said you had to drive clients around in it. In that case, the ES is probably the one for you - as british rover says, the TL is moderately tight for four adults, whereas they will have all the room they need in the ES. Either the ES or the TL should be OK even on a five-year loan, but just remember you will be upside-down in your loan for a while.

Heck, any of the larger domestic sedans ('03, '04 or '05 model years) could be found in that price range all day long (Chrysler 300, Buicks, Mercury or Lincoln, for that matter). "
"woodyww","March 2006"," I don't know the values of these. But I agree with a previous poster, nix the Lexus with 3 owners + repo car.

Do a carfax, & get the previous service history (from a lexus dealer).As a quick guess tho, the 2004 Acura TL with 31k might be the best deal, if it checks out. "
"catam","March 2006"," My .02 FWIW. I'd sit in the back of each to check the legroom for your self, my guess is the TL will be plenty comfy for 4 adults, I know my 04 accord was fine for adults in back. That said, I would vote for the TL or the ES 300 (depending on options on the ES). My first choice would be the TL. Its a sweet ride with plenty of power. The only option avail on an 04 TL was a nav system, they came well equipped, not necessarily true for the ES. Also, buying used you are not likely to take nearly as big a depreciation hit as you would buying new. If you end up turning the car over in a couple of years, the new Mazda 3 will likely be worth half what the TL is. If you want to take maximum advantage of the depreciation hit by buying used, I would recommend buying American, like other posters have mentioned, you could be in a very nice Caddy/ Lincoln, etc for your 21K, and some other sucker paid 10-12K in depreciation for you to have the priveledge of owning a really nice car.My current example, I just traded my wife's 04 Accord EX lthr on an 03 Suburban LT lthr. Bought the Accord for 24500 OTD, and traded it for 17k. Bought the Burb for 18,400 original MSRP was 45K.

"british_rover","March 2006"," keep in mind that the TL is based on the european accord so it is small then the american version of the accord.I love the TL because it is kind of like a grown up Integra but the back seats are tighter then in the ES300. The ES300 is a blah mobile and if the one you are looking at is a 2001 then it is the older body style with the funky frameless windows. Frameless windows are fine if the windows crank down a quarter inch when you open the door then roll up to make a tight seal but Lexus did not do that. "
"andre1969","March 2006"," the one that's based on the European Accord, and is therefore tighter inside than the typical US-market midsizer? I think the TL's actually fairly roomy inside.

Don't they usually run a year behind the Camry?) are pretty cool! I know most people say they're about as dull as it gets, but I always thought the style, at least, was pretty sporty. "

You have to try really hard to wear them out. (I'm on a Toyota kick this week).As far as: *should I be afraid of a miled up Honda?* At 60K, any vehicle is going to start needing stuff replaced.

Which would be OK too, it just might be older than what jolie is looking for. The new RAV4 starts at about $22K for the most basic AWD model. With the Limited you get stuff like bigger rims and factory stereo with subwoofer, but who really needs that stuff? The $22K model has all the stuff most people care about. But of course, it's not a truck and doesn't pretend to be. I think it would make a good snow car, but if a lot of your driving is not on paved roads, I don't know how well it would hold up over time.

A sign from above? who knows. I do know that even after treatment, the car reeked of smoke, and to a nonsmoker like me, that's a dealbreaker.01 GS450 w/44k and nav/ chrome wheels. Beautiful car. I loved how the cockpit really cradled me. very smooth v8 in it. Acceleration was great. the G's were noticible when I punched it. Though I didnt time it or anything when doing a 60-80mph passing test, it felt a little more sluggish in that range than the tl did. The interior was clean, but some of the writing on the buttons on the front console were starting to fade/rub off. Really enjoyed driving it, and as I spend about 90-120min in the car per day, it scored more points than I wanted it to. Because of the 3 owners, I'd get this on a lift and have a mechanic take a look before I bought it. They're asking 21k.'04 Acura TL Auto with 31k mi: all standard stuff, no options here. This was raw and animalistic where the Lexus was silky. The interior of this one was less worn than the gs, and really good looking, but I have a kid and from time to time will be putting a childseat in the back. I've read that the perforated leather in this car is more prone to tearing, which makes me pause somewhat. The lexus leather felt a little thicker. Driving was comfortable, but less ""cockpit-y"" than the lexus. Cool standard features were dvd-audio and bluetooth. No nav though. They're asking 24.5k for it.Unfortunately, I liked the lexus more than practicality says I should and it's 3k cheaper and has more features. The acura has warranty, is newer, gets better mpg, fewer miles, but is 3.5k more expensive. To me it's a dead heat.I'm one of those people (like some of you) who follow cars relentlessly, always dreaming of the next one, and can find something I like in almost anything. Unfortunately this broadens the field like mad. I think I'll be taking my time, test-driving a ton, and really getting a feel for my options and priorities to narrow things down.( And re the accord, I've owned 2, both were great cars, and may check it out, but as it stands, the acura at $24.5k is a little more than I'd like to spend, so I'm not real comfortable stretching further.)

"davesbrew","March 2006"," Re: Saturn Vue reliability. I recently checked consumer reports for reliability of these, as we have access to the GM discount and was considering it, CR lists the awd vue on their "" used cars to avoid"" list and has the new vue AWD at about 60% worse predicted reliability than the average car. They predict the fwd version to be slightly better than the average car. For whatever that's worth. I know honda makes the saturn vue redline engine, but am not sure whether that's awd or fwd. "
"british_rover","March 2006"," Take everything CR says with a grain of salt. In fact you might want to take it with a whole salt mine thrown in. The best way to see how reliable a vehicle is is to look at what extended warranty companies rate the warranty at. Extended warranties are graded on a scale from A or AA down to like L or M. Cheaper warranties, for more reliable cars/cheaper to fix cars, are rated in the A-C range. Cars that cost more to fix and break most often get J or K ratings. Everything else is in between.I would put more faith in the warranty raitings then CR's ratings since the warranty company actualy has to back up those ratings with money. If they screw up and rate a car a B when it actually more of a G then that will cost them big money. If CR screws up then it does not really cost them anything. Maybe a few subscribers will cancel their subscritpion but I doubt it.When CR does their predicted reliablity of a car that has just been completly redesigned instead of just saying either they don't know or putting a footnote by their ranking letting people know it is based off the old model they just use the old predicted realiblity. When a car really is completly redesigned and nothing from the old car carries over then you cannot predict its relablity based off the old model. They should just say this but they do not. "
"gee35coupe","March 2006"," Micheal has also stated he has done his share or repair work on his Saturn. Most people, myself included, that recommend Hondas and Toyota have owned several examples of them and never hed any expensive repairs. I've had very few expensive non-maintenance repairs on a Honda or Toyota. I would say never but I'll just say very few because I'm sure there has to be one or two, I just can't remember any right now. A $500 brake job sounds about right for a well done job at a brake shop. But a ""body control module"" is something else. I do my own brakes though. Advance/Autozone pads and rotors are CHEAP.As far as the extended warranty being the judge or reliability. I'll agree with that. I used to work for Carmax and extended warranty prices do vary greatly from brand to brand. In fact, Carmax won't even sell many brands past a certain mileage because the warranty company won't cover them. "

"british_rover","March 2006"," Most people have no idea about them and it is not something you can probably just go look up on your own. If you have a good relationship with someone in the dealership business, or even if you don't have a good relationship but you go in on a slow weekday, just ask the F&I to show you his warranty rating chart. There is probably somewhere online you can find the raitings but they do vary a little bit from company to company. CNA is a pretty big aftermarket warranty company and they sell warranties for just about every vehicle. "

"michaellno","March 2006"," I'm just not the kind of person who is comfortable doing his own maintenance work - probably stems from the time when I was in HS when I drained the transmission fluid then added 4 quarts of oil.

For the most part, it's regular PM and not much else.Had I known then (when I bought the L) what I know now about the repair costs, I might have been more inclined to purchase an extended warranty, or gone with a different manufacturer. Que sera, sera, as Doris Day sang. Not much I can do about it now.Yes, I happen to like Saturns, but the recent experiences I've had with the L will make me think long and hard about going down that path again. For the $16-17K that they want for an ION, I might take a closer look at the alternatives - Scion xA, Toyota Yaris, Hyundai Elantra, etc.I've got my fingers crossed that the wife's VUE doesn't experience the same kind of issues -- but, we did get the extended warranty (6/75K) on hers, so I guess it won't matter as much.Does anyone know if Mazda plans on offering something smaller than the 3 here in the US?

Equipped the way I would like (auto, ABS, keyless entry), we're still in the $15-16K price range. The Fit is intriguing, I will say.I did speak with the sales manager at the Saturn dealership and had him give me an estimate on the value of the L as a trade in. He gave it a cursory look and offered $11,500.The good news is that I think the payoff value will now decrease faster than the rate of depreciation, so if I decide to wait a few more months, I ought to have even more equity available.

"michaellno","March 2006"," No, I would not only consider another Saturn to replace the L when the time comes. I believe that I've stated my reasons why I might be inclined to do so.The L was sort of a [non-permissible content removed] in the Saturn (heck, GM) lineup - quasi European in nature (similar to the Opel/Vauxhall Vectra and, to a lesser extent, the Saab 9-3), so the problems that I've had with the L I would not expect to have on the ION (similar to the Chevy Cobalt) or the wifes VUE (which has the Honda 3.5L V6 and 5-speed auto transmission).One of the big reasons why I've been partial to Saturns in the past is the use of the polymer side panels. Unfortunately, going forward Saturn is phasing them out - the Relay doesn't use them, nor does the recently introduced Sky. Same with the Aura and the Opel-sourced replacement for the ION in '08.So, in the future, Saturns will be just another derivative of other GM offerings. As such, I will be sure to look at other brands, makes and models when the time comes.EDIT: up until a month ago, the L300 has been quite reliable -- just got hit with a couple of big issues in a short amount of time.

"akangl","March 2006"," Well dang, test drove that cute little 04 Escape last night, it was ok, but the door dinger, dome light, and stereo didn't work. I'm guessing a fuse, but I got a hinky feeling about it, it had some paint missing on the front bumper too.I started looking around the lot while my poor salesguy was hobbling around looking for the keys to the Escape (he's having knee surgery this morning). Well, I looked at the Ford Freestyle, that thing is cool. So after coming back from the Escape test drive I asked to drive a Freestyle, he got the keys to one and I drove it. Kind of a cool mom car, but it got me thinking hard about the Pilot too. Me thinks I'm going to wait and think this over, I can't make up my mind what I want to do. If I wait until October I can have Zippy paid off and maybe be able to swing a Pilot or Freestyle, which means I won't have to switch cars in a couple years to get what I want.I dunno, going back in there next week so hubby can order his new truck, that is if he decides on Ford.....he's stuck on Chevy at the moment.My salesguy is really cool, we've bought 2 vehicles from him in the past (the Dodge and the 04 Explorer), we were both hobbling in sync last night. I've managed to goof up my left knee again, that that means no driving Zippy for a little while until it heals.Help me out guys......what to buy?? Oh heck, maybe I'll just keep the Titan or Zippy. :confuse: "
"bobw3","March 2006"," I was looking at the Freestyle & Pilot (and Highlander) too, and I went with the Freestyle. For me, space was the main issue. The legroom in the Freestyle's 2nd row is 40.4 and 33.3 in the 3rd row, and there is 21 cubic feet of luggage space behind the 3rd row. For the Pilot, the legroom in the 2nd rwo is only 37.4 and 30.2 in the 3rd row, and cargo space is only 16 cubic feet behind the 3rd row. This is all from the Ford & Honda official webpages. So for me, the extra cargo space, plus the extra 3 inches in the 2nd & 3rd row made the difference. The Freestyle is 10 inches longer, but for me it's necessary if you want to make a three row vehicle comfortable and practical. Cost was another issue. I bought a Freestyle FWD SE with tri-level climate controls (extra a/c & heater in the back), convenience group & safety package all for $24K. I think the Pilot would have cost at least a few thousand more. "
"gee35coupe","March 2006"," It has a VERY nice stance on the road. But the teeny tiny engine and CVT-only tranny keep me from being totally enamored. That just looks like too much car for 200hp. One thing about the MDX/Pilot is that 3.5 engine. Our MDX would haul when you struck your foot in it. The same for our ODY. I had it full of people and it still had beans to jump from 85 to 100 mph if you wanted it to. I was impressed. "

"tifighter","March 2006"," Update to post 5881-Looked at the Mazda5 and the 05 Legacy 2.5i wagon. 5 is a neat package, lots of nooks and crannies to store stuff in. Looks sharp in person. The third row folds pretty flat but not completely flat. Not one of those disappear into the floor deals like a minivan. Available manual tranny shifts nicely. Power is acceptable but not overwhelming. Expected that coming into it, though. Sales guy seemed bored talking about it; have concluded that a majority of black leather coat market must pivot around guys in car sales. Drove the Legacy wagon the next day. Drove very nicely, and more peppy then I expected for the base engine. I am sure the manual helps out here. Nice interior, huge amount of room in the cargo area. And gets better gas mileage than the Mazda despite AWD. I still think it's Subaru's best looking car. Concerns- this is a big car, and is a little longer then my ideal. I may be able to live with it. Hard to put an aftermarket stereo in the non-DIN center console and I am WAY too used to ipod integration in my BMW to not have it on my next car. Had a small dent in the drivers door, but that should come out with little trouble. Also has a trailer hitch on it, which may indicate a harder early life. Clean, one owner Carfax. I liked this car more than I thought I would, though; more than the Mazda5.I am going to check out a new Forester X manual tomorrow. Looked at one in the past but only found an automatic. Hoping the manual helps as I was not blown away by the Forester before. But it is the right size and I have to admit the current incentives make them a killer value. Nothing wrong with new. Would be slightly more than the Legacy. Decisions, decisions... "

Before, you could not get a sunroof unless you moved up to the Acura MDX. Just curious, could you pull the travel trailer with the Pilot?

"bobw3","March 2006"," That just looks like too much car for 200hp.I think the comment above is the main reason people assume the Freestyle is underpowered. If you read the comments on the Freestyle forum where it's actually being driven, you won't find anyone complaining about the power. Bottom line is that is that the underpowered comments are a perception based on the size of the car and engine, rather than a reality of driving the car after being used to the CVT transmission.The CVT does take a little getting used to, which again is one of the reasons that car reviewers and people who only test drive them might assume the Freestyle is underpowered. As far as the CVT...at 75mph on cruise control on drives across the Appalachian mountains, the RPMs were around 2000-2500 and never went above 3000rpms even on the steepest parts, so it's not running at the redline for normal driving. Yes, if you're used to flooring the gas all of the time after stoplights, then you'll get the revs up, but that's not normal driving. Plus with the CVT, it doesn't keep jumping between 5th and 4th gear like a regular automatic...since there are no gears. Again, unless you're flooring the gas, it's a very gradual progression in the transmission.Even though both the Freestyle and Pilot do 0-60 in about 8.5 seconds, it does depend on what you consider adequate power. For me, after putting on 26K miles and over a year of driving the Freestyle in the mountains and passing other cars on two lane roads, it has plenty of power. And I really like the CVT on the mountain roads because it's much smoother than an automatic that constantly searches for the right gear. The CVT also does a great job with engine braking going down the steep hills. The CVT helps with the mpg too, as I average 25mpg on the highway at speeds of 70-75mph. The only time the CVT/engine combination is rough is when you really stomp on the gas, floor it and hold it there. If that's your kind of driving, then you probably wouldn't like the Freestyle. "

"qbrozen","March 2006"," Even though both the Freestyle and Pilot do 0-60 in about 8.5 secondswell, to be accurate, C&D has the Pilot at 7.6 (03/04) and the Freestyle at 8.2 (01/05).

Hubby was already planning on buying a new truck, he needs a diesel for the weights he's pulling and wanted a crew cab as opposed to a reg cab like he has now. So we opted to trade the Dodge and the Titan in on the new truck when it gets here (he's ordering one on Tuesday). The new truck will take over for the Titan (crew cab) and the Dodge (1-ton dually) which means it will also pull the TT. That way I don't need to drive a big truck anymore, so that makes the Pilot perfect.It was hard to even think about getting rid of the Titan before since that meant I had to buy a big SUV (suburban or excursion) to pull the TT. I didn't want to go bigger, I have enough trouble parking my land yacht as it is.I wanted to keep Zippy, but we need to get down to 2 vehicles, the extra $1500/year in insurance doesn't make sense anymore since we don't need 3 vehicles.

"nippononly","April 2006"," I have driven the TL quite a bit now. Only the automatic though. I would imagine the standard limited slip in the manual helps a LOT with this model, as the auto can't seem to keep its feet on the ground and pulling when you corner hard. Having said that, I have always valued great handling over raw power, and the TL doesn't communicate enough to the driver what it's doing. I am not a great fan of its steering, and clearly the stock all-seasons suck - here again, the summer tires probably help a lot.

"nippononly","April 2006"," that was the IS350 those comments referenced though, and I can sympathize with the world of professional auto journalists that if you have 306 hp on tap but VDIM shuts you down every two minutes, and especially when you are trying to have a bit of fun, it must be frustrating.The smaller engine only has enough power to give this car average performance with the manual, but returns a 30+ rating for highway mpg rating and should have handling much better suited to its power level. I would imagine there is a whole lot less VDIM intrusion with the reduced power. The letdown could come in the form of steering that feels remote. But a lot of the cars in this class feel that way, which just makes the class less desirable to me, not making any excuses for the IS here. The exception is probably the 3-series, but for me it goes against the grain to pay the $5-8K premium just for good road feel, especially when they charge extra for metallic paint and the like.

That Tahoe is way cool, great gas mileage too...........argh!!

"tifighter","April 2006"," Thanks. First new car I've ever bought. I had the ipod running through the factory stereo on my BMW; track names and artists scroll across the display. After using this, carrying CD's around just seems so stupid! The trick will be finding the deck that looks the most factory; I'm not into the dancing dolphin displays on most aftermarket stuff these days. "
"qbrozen","April 2006"," LOL, at 6-4 I've NEVER had the dream as I simply cannot fit in any 2 seat convertible, affordable or otherwise.ah, but dare to dream. I haven't tried the convertible, actually, but, at 6'5"", I fit comfortably in a 350z coupe, so I wouldn't be surprised if I'd find the same in the droptop.Also, it depends on what you mean by ""fitting."" I can fit in many 2-seat convertibles ... fitting comfortably is a different story. I manage to drive around in my Alfa Spider, but I wouldn't want to go on a long drive in it. "
"guss","April 2006"," You missed the other key word, affordable. A new 350z is $35k and used you probably could not touch one for under $25k.I have driven Alfa Spider's and would not mind taking a long trip in yours.  "
"michaellno","April 2006"," Affordable is a pretty big word in my vocabulary, too.When the time comes that I can add the 'fun' car to my collection, I'm pretty sure I'll have a budget of around $25K. Which probably means I'm looking at cars that are a few years old (Boxster, Audi TT convertible, SLK, etc.).But, that's down the road a few years, I suspect. "
"qbrozen","April 2006"," i didn't miss it ... i just misinterpreted it. Actually, I tried out a Miata once. Really not bad (a bit more legroom than my alfa). And now the new one is supposed to be even roomier, so I wouldn't be surprised if it is a nice fit for folks like us. "
"gee35coupe","April 2006"," I'd get an older Miata..Nicely used ones can be had for around $2500. I'd buy it, drive it a while, then sell it. "

I've looked at SUVs and other trucks but I'm driving the one I love most of all. Every time I think I want a new car I ask myself ""am I going to be happy with this for X years?"" The answer is always no, then I get into my Titan and drive away. I'm done, not looking anymore. Will buy the Titan out of the lease instead of buying a new car.Hubby ordered a 2006 Dodge Ram 3500 dually Cummins/auto 4x4, will be here end of June early July. "
"andre1969","April 2006"," I sat in one at the auto show, and it didn't seem too bad inside. The Solstice I sat in felt more cramped. I also sat in an S2000 and was really disappointed, because it was really tight. And of all the little 2-seat roadsters, I think that one was my favorite, style-wise. "
"guss","April 2006"," Is the fastest of that group and is my favorite in the styling dept. also .But, it is really cramped.I have yet to try a Z3, they seem to be coming down in price since the Z4 has been out a while. The Z4 has to be the least attractive 2 seat roadster i have seen in a long time. That flame surfacing does nothing for me. "
"qbrozen","April 2006"," oh, i really like the Z4 styling.Also like the S2k, but as everyone else pointed out, its too cramped. I sat in a used one for about 20 minutes trying to convince myself I could make it work. Obviously, I was not successful. "
"andre1969","April 2006"," I kinda like the Z4's style. I thought the Z3 was sexier, though. My main beef about the Z4 is that up close, they just look cheaply assembled. I rememeber seeing a few at the Philly auto show, and the paint on them looked really weak. And when you opened the hood, the engine bay just looked unfinished and sloppy. And the fenders were shimmed! Well, okay, it's not like they used half a quarter roll's worth like GM might have done back in the 60's, but still...I thought shims went the way of the carburetor?If it were a lesser, cheaper car I probably wouldn't care, but c'mon, this thing is a BMW!! I know everybody's getting hurt by competition and cost cutting, but on something like a BMW I don't expect it to show up so flagrantly. "

"corvette","April 2006"," Cost-cutting in the new 3-series:* No height-adjustable belts.* No lamps or reflectors on an open door's edge facing traffic coming up from behind.* No metallic paint under the hood or inside body cavities--it's the same color as the primer. I'm sure there's a coat of flat paint over the primer in the body cavities, but if you're going to have the gall to charge extra for metal-flake paint, don't be skimpy with it. In spite of that, I still love the car. 12,400 miles and counting. I don't know what to look for on the fenders... Are you talking about making the sheetmetal 3/4 of the way boxed like the new F-150? "
"michaellno","April 2006"," Wow ... no adjustable belts in the 3-series?Every car in my stable (Focus, L300 and VUE) has this feature. Quite nice when you are 5'11"" and your wife is 5'3"".That's one of those things that you don't think about it until you don't have it. For example, the wife's VUE does not have heated mirrors. Didn't realize it until we had the first snow after buying it. Previous vehicles that she drove (Explorer, Expedition, VW New Beetle) all had it. Nice to have here in Colorado; my L300 has it.Re: Z4. The last time I went to the auto show, I made it a point to sit in all the 2-seat roadsters, just to see which ones I fit into. The Z4 fit me the best -- the seat went back far enough, I could see all the gauges, my head didn't pop over the top of the windshield, there was enough elbow room. Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the 'flame-surfacing' on the sides, but I think I could live with it. "
"qbrozen","April 2006"," interesting, but i have no idea why they think it competes with the Elise when it costs almost $30k more. "
"woodyww","April 2006"," What does a *2006 Dodge Ram 3500 dually Cummins/auto 4x4* go for these days? Sounds like a Major Vehicle.As one of us in the Lower 48, I'd love to hear more sometime about what kind of vehicle is needed in AK, & why? About all I know about Alaska is from history books, & from that excellent TV show from way back in the 1990's......uuummmmm.......can't think of the name right now.....Northern Exposure! "
"michaellno","April 2006"," I spent a week in Anchorage a number of years ago on business and found that, at least in the city, most any car will suffice. Just like any major city that gets lots of snow, I would think that the roads are kept pretty clear.Can't really speak for any other areas ... I was there in May, and rented a GMC Jimmy ""just because"". Took a drive to Seward and a regular car would have gotten me there just fine. The roads that I took were all paved. The one thing that I do notice is that the price of used vehicles is pretty crazy, as I'm sure jolie would attest to. Take a look at the classified at www.adn.com (Anchorage Daily News) and you'll see what I mean.Not a huge number of roads to be found in Alaska; for example, you cannot drive to the state capital (Juneau) as there are no roads connecting it to the rest of the state. Must use either air or ferry to get there.I'm sure Jolie can expand on this. "
"woodyww","April 2006"," Man I dunno know. I think between a used Z3, Z4, or S2000, I'd just go between whatever one(s) I'd found at the best price, in the best condition.I don't know about the opinions expressed re: the Z4 regarding build quality. But if I found a nice used one at a great price, that's what I'd go for. That or an E46 3-series. The ""flame surface"" critiques of the Z4.......personally, I think they look great, but then, I've drunk the ""bmw cool-aid"".... "
"tifighter","April 2006"," I had a Z3; let me weigh in. I originally was looking for a Miata but could not fit in it. No way, no how. I am 6'3"" and 210 lbs. Not only was the seat travel limited, but the non-tilt steering wheel gave me major clearance issues when using the clutch. The S2K was pretty tight too, but slightly better. Also, I'm not crazy about the S2K image. The Z3, with height adjustment on the seat, was definitely the most comfortable, and it felt more solid to boot. Nice torquey six was a great all-arounder and I never had any problems with the car. The Z4 is nice but was out of my price range. But I did sit in one and it seemed a little bit roomier than the Z3. Another car I really liked was the MR2 spyder; roomier than you'd think, THE most fun to drive, but has zip for storage. Still, its a winner. "
"gee35coupe","April 2006"," That is my usual MO. But the Miata would be VERY temporary. I've always liked em though. Especially the first gen. That little stubby stick is nice. I just barely can fit my 6'6' butt in there. But I'm used to that.The more I drive my 1996 Civic the more I love it. This is our third silver 4 door 1996 5 speed Civic EX. And this it the best one as far as I'm concerned. I'm doing the brakes this weekend and having the timing belt done next week. After a quick trip to the junk yard for a few little nic-nacs, i may keep this car til 200k. I'm gonna post some pic on a cars[ace page one day. "
"corvette","April 2006"," The belt fits me fine (I'm 5'6""), so it's not something I worry too much about. I really missed having heated mirrors when I had the Altima--the apartment I lived in when I had the Altima was next to a body of water, and I often had fog on all the windows and mirrors in the morning. It's also a nice touch to have weatherstripping at the bottom of the side windows that fits tight enough to wipe off any condensation. The 3 scores points here. The Jetta did this, but the Altima wasn't so good at that. Keeping in mind I'm only 5'6"", I found the S2000 to be cramped. I could probably do a Miata, Boxster, or Z3/Z4 as a daily driver. "
"sandman46","April 2006"," I was very impressed with the seats in the Sebring I had for a rental a couple of months ago. Since my accident last April, I need a very supportive seat with a decent sized head rest, as my neck down through my lower spine and legs have been affected. The power seat had a multitude of adjustments which worked for me. I sit on a pillow in my current Sentra, as the seats are like rocks and I hardly ever drive the Mazda3, but it's seats are also pretty hard.Has anyone tried the seats in the new Civic EX and if so, how did they feel? We're going up to New Hampshire in June for my sons high school graduation and hopefully Alamo will have a nice selection of mid-sized cars that have a power drivers seat. The Malibu I had 2 years ago was unacceptable and was returned within a day for a power seated car.The Sandman  "
"gee35coupe","April 2006"," The new Civic seats were the best part of the car. They seemed to just wrap around me. They made me overlook how much I detest that new instrument panel. But then again, I'm 6'6' and about 220 lb. so your results may differ. "
"sandman46","April 2006"," I'm only 5'7"" and weigh about 160 and have somewhat sort legs. I fit pretty well in both the Sentra and the 3, but have to sit on a pillow, which makes the ceiling pretty close to my head actually. Especially with the Sentra. Haven't found a better solution but have to find one soon. I have to back into any car I drive and then swing my legs over and in before I bring my cane in the car.Am hoping the new Civic seats will be as comfortable as the Sebrings or I might have to look for another make. My focus has to be on comfort 1st, as the doctors tell me I will never get better...only worse.Saw a Volve S240 up close today and was very impressed with the looks and size of it. If it's cloth seats turn out to be very comfortable, that couls also be in the running.The Sandman :confuse: "
"stickguy","April 2006"," Funny, but the comfort of the drivers seat (or lack of same) was the deal breaker that took the civic off my list! I split the difference between you guys, at 6' even, but I have a long torso relative to my height I think.Not enough adjustment, the bottom was lumpy in the wrong spots, and the non-adjustable lumbar support hit me wrong. Other than that, no problems!You should like the S40, it is something I was going to recommend if you need back support and adjustability. Try a Jetta too, fantastic seats, and even power lumbar that even adjusts up and down (to go along with in/out).Seats are a big issue for me, and I have passed on otherwise fine cars because I didn't like the seats.

Head and legroom were good too. Chrysler products for the most part seem to have the interiors that fit me well.I sat in a pretty loaded one that stickered for under $20k. Not a bad deal, but I would wait and pick up a used one in a couple of years. "
"guss","April 2006"," Why the '96? Was there something special compared to the '95 & '97 or is it just that is the model that keeps crossing your path. "
"gee35coupe","April 2006"," Same color and everything. Actually one of them was a 1998 though. So it's only 2 96's. But we've owned like 10 or so various Civics over the years. We're bound to repeat. "

"woodyww","April 2006"," I've been looking at the the new Rav4 brochure, & reading some of the reviews. It seems like a lot of vehicle for the $$--of course, with a Toyota, they nickel & dime for every option, & the Rav4 gets into the upper $20K area if you want it ""loaded"".I like the fact that you get roughly as much cargo capacity as a 4Runner, with much better gas mileage, for less $$. (I know they are very different vehicles, & a Rav4 won't do everything a 4Runner can do like off-road). I like the pics too.....as if it's transcended the ""cute-ute"" look..... "
"sandman46","April 2006"," One of these was behind and then next to us on the way home about 10 minutes ago. I like what they've done with it for '07. Wonder if I could get one with auto and a power pack for under $20k out the door? If it's not to much bigger than the Sentra or Civic in length, it would fit on my side of the garage. A Camry sized car just won't fit, so I have a size limitation to contend with at the house.The wife gave it a good look and said it was great and even liked the ride height. Hmmmmmm!!! The seats I know will also be a deal breaker for me.

"woodyww","April 2006"," You can check out the prices, etc. on Edmunds or at http://www.toyotausa.com. The base RAV4 4cyl., FWD starts at $20,300.I think trying to get great seats in a small Japanese economy car may be difficult(?). You might have to spend more--or get a bigger car. I know Mercedes used to offer ""orthopedic"" seats as an option--I suppose you could look for a used M-B with those, but might be hard to find.Would the seating position of a small SUV be better than a small car, & at least eliminate the pillow?

I'll think I'm fine again, and then do something strenuous and bam...I'm right back where I was again.It seems like once upon a time, cars had more support in the lower part of the backrest, than they do today. Unless you get the lumbar adjustment option, but then it seems to hit me funny. Otherwise, many modern cars forced me into a slumping position; it's like they're too hollowed out towards the bottom of the backrest, but then there's too much padding up where your shoulders are. "
"akangl","April 2006"," After test driving many vehicles lately in our search for a new truck I found that the lumbar was the worst option in the world. I have a pinched siatic (sp?) nerve and it doesn't take much to aggrevate it. Chevy truck seats hurt, Ford truck seats hurt, the only one that was comfortable was the leather seats in the Dodge, the cloth was way too hard. First thing I do when I get into a vehicle is make sure the lumbar is all the way off and not out in any way.The Titan has been a comfortable truck for the most part, but long distances (over 200 miles) bother me. Zippy I can tolerate for 15 miles or so then my back hurts. If I would have had this back problem when I was working at Walmart I would have never been able to commute like I did.Heated seats are nice too........too bad the driver's side one in the Titan is trying to bite the dust!

"british_rover","April 2006"," You need to look into an older Merc/BMW that has the sport package with the 16 way contour seats.

"stickguy","April 2006"," try a back store, or look on the internet for one. They have all kinds of different pillows/cushions, so you might find one that does what you want. "
"sandman46","April 2006"," These stores are awesome, I got a coccyx cushion there so I can sit at my new position at work. It's basically that Tempurpedic bed material in a seat cuschion with a carrying handle. I can actually sit for longer stretches of time with it. Still fighting workers comp to pay the bill for it. So far they have denied it eventhough I supplied my orthopedic's perscription. I'd have bought it either way though...simply amazing.We also just got a topper for our bed from Overstock.com. It's a 3"" pad made of the same memory foam that's on the bed commercial on t v. Definitely helps me to sleep at night.A friend at work sells cars and today he invited me to go with him to the Ft. Lauderdale/Miami auto action. He says in the late afternoon, they leave the keys in the cars and you can go sit in as many as you'd like. He agreed with me that the only way to tell if a drivers seat will be comfortable enough is to sit in as many of my choices that I can back to back. A great way to compare seats.The Sandman  "
"corvette","April 2006"," Sometimes, you can tell right away that a seat doesn't fit well, other times, it takes 30 minutes or so before you know for sure, but the auction should help you get some ideas of what you want to look at further... If it's for your back, it will be easier to convince the wife. Have fun at the auto auction. It's interesting to be able to see a couple thousand late model cars run through the lanes! "
"woodyww","April 2006"," Just an idea: go to a Volvo store, & maybe a bmw store, & sit in as many new & used cars as possible. I really think you have to ""pay up"" for good car seats. I read the edmunds review of the bmw X3, & they were raving about the seats, the sport seats I think. My current car--a bmw E39 5-series--has very good seats. Power, heated, leather, seat memory, but no lumbar adjust. Very comfortable on long trips. I don't think they're as good as the best Volvo seats I've tried, or the ""Sport"", or ""Comfort"" bmw seats......but I've never been uncomfortable in them.My back is so ""bad"", at least occasionally, that I'm kind of obsessed with good seating. I have an Aeron chair in my office/computer room. I also have one of those reclining Ekornes chairs that are about $1100 new, but I scored a nice used one for $350 or so on craig's list.....of course I screwed up my back more getting it into my bmw wagon, but at least I was comfortable driving home.

So I really think a car with a power seat will do the trick actually.Another friend at work got an HHR last week and he said it has a partial drivers power lower seat. I did sit in the passenger seat and it wasn't as hard as my Sentra chairs. But I know a S40 will fit on my side of the garage, as the 3 is the same body shell and it fits nicely.The Sandman  "
"guss","April 2006"," Several years ago I bought a pump up lumbar for my Explorer. It was basically an air bladder that went under the seat fabric and attached to the seat frame with zip ties. It used a hand pump like a blood pressure monitor to add and take air out.The company I bought it from went out of business but you may be able to find one at the back stores mentioned previously. I don't have a bad back, but it made the seating position alot more comfortable. "
"jjtj","April 2006"," There is a company called Rostra that makes aftermarket lumbar kits as well as seat heaters. They come with OEM looking controls and work well, and are not expensive. The seat heaters can be wired so that only the back part comes on if you want.. this is so it can be used for back relief in the warmer months, as well as for warmth in the winter. I thought about retrofitting my wife's minivan as she loves the heated seats in my truck but haven't got around to it just yet. "
"sandman46","April 2006"," Unfortunately, my problem is in my lower back way down across the whole back in the tailbone area, thus the difficulty sitting. I like a power bottom cushion so I can manipulate the pressure points in my butt area. The pillow method I use now in my Sentra just isn't working. The seats in the 3 aren't much better either, thus my dilemma.Must be a sign from G-D, but the check engine light came on in the Sentra this morning and it's back in the dealer tonight. I assume it's the 4th coil that needs replacing, hopefully nothing else. The warranty runs out May 31st, so timing may be on my side here. Just wish dealers would be a little more proactive on things like this. But Enterprise gave me a Sorrento to use in the mean time.

Sitting is not the problem for me, it's standing; if I stand for a period of time my back starts to kill me and I have to sit down. At almost 48 yrs old, I will fight old age as much as I can!I have the Multi-contour seats in my Mercedes E-430 that have air bellows that fill the lower and upper seat back separately. There is also a control for the sides to sqeeze you in. I think the seat is a 10 way power seat so there are tons of selections. I like to move my seat a lot, especially on driving trips. To stay even more on subject, I went with my friend today to check out the new 2007 Mercedes-Benz S550. It's really nice but the exterior is not making a home run but it's OK. Since I sat in the back seat, I noticed there are two window switches on each door. No matter what side of the car you are on, you can lower either side from each door!

Our big fancy new car was an Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser wagon... it even had a tailgate power window!... at least it had air-conditioning... for 1969, our first car with air! I had to buy my first car on a part-time job. The only child that was given a car was my youngest sister so she was the spoiled one; she deserved it being the last child. She's a cool sis now! So, I guess I've done better than my parents financially but they raised a close and wonderful family which you cannot put a price on.

A sad comentary indeed.I have a Sorrento LX rental car now and it's just to big and way tall for me. So maybe a small ute will work for me. Am still partial to the S40 though but I hear Volvo reliability isn't that great. Luckily, I don't need to buy anything right away. I have the luxury of time and eventhough the Sentra with only 28k miles on it will bring the most for a trade in or a private sell now, I'm just not gonna jump into anything. I'm patient and will try many cars and seats before this process is done. As long as the back and neck hold out...I'm game!The Sandman :confuse: "
"corvette","April 2006"," Wow, that stinks... Divorces and inheritance disputes really tend to bring out the worst in people. When I was a wee lad, my parents had a succession of GM products. Dad had GMC trucks and vans for his electronics store, and Mom had Pontiac sedans and wagons. Later, Dad closed his business and started commuting a good deal away from the town where we lived, and he bought Hondas and loved them for their economy. Mom has had Volvos since 1990... Despite plenty of missteps, things have turned out better than expected for all of us. Even though I am often a pessimist, I have a lot to be thankful for! "

I know it is not a popular to do so in this forum,keeping it for anything more than a burned out lamp would be ridiculous.But, there are aftermarket seats(like Recaro) that can be installed for less than a grand. Aftermarket companies that build handicap vans can modify the seat frame if needed. Just a thought. "
"woodyww","April 2006"," Those must be awesome seats. Are they like what M-B used to call Ortho seats?The only Mercedes seats I ever experienced were the standard, stock or base seats in the early '90's E-class, & a '97 E-class. Not great, probably worse than the ""standard"" seats in a bmw.But yours sound terrific. What year E-430 is it? One of my many car theories is that seats could be THE most important part of a car. Or that, you'll probably only get great seats in an excellent (& probably expensive) car..... *I have the Multi-contour seats in my Mercedes E-430 that have air bellows that fill the lower and upper seat back separately. There is also a control for the sides to sqeeze you in. I think the seat is a 10 way power seat so there are tons of selections.* "
"mark156","April 2006"," Hello Woody... my E430 sport is a 2000. Maybe my seats are the ""ortho"" seats but when I purchased mine, they were listed as ""multi-contour"" seats. The Two Thousand Mercedes E-classes were updated from when they were first introduced in 1996. The hood was lowered about an inch and a half, the lip on the truck lid is deeper, the tail-lights were changed, the front bumper cover was redesigned, the turning signal indicators are incorporated into the mirrors, the steering wheel controls for the radio and computer were added, upgraded interior materials, etc. They say there were 1,800 changes from the 1996-1999 models, but who knows for sure.When the hood was lowered, the diesel was discontinued because it wouldn't fit under the hood. The diesel was re-introduced in 2005.Mark  "

I traded in my 1991 560SEL (Black w/Palomino Leather, 83K) on the E-class. Actually, my 560SEL had the ""orthopedic"" seats that were very similar to the ""Multi-contour"" on the E-class. The ortho seats didn't squeeze you on the sides, just the bellows in the back of the seat.My E-class listed for $60,500 and I got a $1,000 discount back then. When I bought my 2002 ML500, it listed for $52,000 and I got $1,500 off list. I traded the ML500 in on a 2006 Land Rover LR3 HSE, black with tan leather.. I really like it as it has seating for 7 like the ML but much more space. My E-class only has 32,000 miles so I'll keep if for a while. It has been very, very low maintenance so far.

The truck is expected the 3rd week of June.After much discussion it was decided that since the 99 Ram will be paid off in 2 more payments that it's going to stay. 'Cides, who wants to take a brand new truck out in the woods and throw firewood at it??That means my beloved Titan and my precious Zippy are both leaving in June when the new truck gets here. I had mixed feelings but after seeing what towing all those trailers has done to the Titan I felt it might not hurt to move up to a bigger truck. After 50,000 miles I don't have anything bad to say about the Titan, its a tough truck.Now Zippy I'm having a harder time giving up, she will probably be sold in the next month or so. Already have people asking. After 53k miles she has had exactly 4 repairs......seatbelt retractor, alignment, PCV valve, and a door adjustment. She still drives like a new car and gets great gas mileage. However, she also does a lot of idle time in the yard, she's had maybe 1500 miles put on her in the past 6 months.

"corvette","April 2006"," The Beetle TDI is not nearly as common as the Jetta. Skimming eBay's completed listings has given me figures of $8,000-ish for a 2002-03 Jetta with similar mileage, and some of those were in very rough shape. Dad's has no dents or scratches and has fairly new tires. As for unexpected repairs, it's already had plenty of those. The timing belt and tensioner were replaced on schedule at 100k. The tensioner locked up at 119k, but I shut off the engine before it was damaged. The front bumper was gouged in the process of towing it to the mechanic after that incident, but has been repainted. Something in the ignition system let go and caused a CEL, so we just replaced all the glow plugs and the harness, which fixed the problem... I could go on, but would rather not. :lemon: Getting 49 MPG is nice, but we are willing to pay higher gas bills for life's little conveniences, like not being left stranded, and having a decent dealer network with competent repair facilities, neither of which are available from VW.

"nippononly","April 2006"," went around doing a little window shopping tonight, and there are too many choices!The VW dealer has a gazillion leftover '05 Jettas (the new model) and is offering $5555 off MSRP for all of them, blanket policy. That brings the nice model with package 1 down to less than $18K, and he had a few with a stick!OTOH, I found that rarity of rarities: a 5-speed Accord EX stick with cloth, in this case an '04 with 17K miles for $19,9 certified. But then I walked across the lot and they had stick shift Civic EXs in stock, which would be a new car for slightly less money, and really I don't need a car as big as the Accord anyway, although I do really like the current model. And on the more minimalist side of things, I finally found a Yaris stick shift with cruise - it is loaded to the gills with the biggest package Toyota could shove in there, the color is blue, and the sticker is exactly $16K. Of course, for $16K, I could get a Corolla S stick and get a moonroof and side airbags and curtains for the same money. I am still convinced that the only Yaris that makes sense value-wise is the base model with stickers up to about $14K. Beyond that, there is so much competition!And shoot, that Toyota dealer had an '05 Mini Cooper S stick shift with only 7450 miles on it that looked sweet and he was asking $24K - I am assuming he would come down a bit, and it had me wondering if maybe I shouldn't wait and save up a bit for something like that. Of course, at that kind of price, I would probably just go the extra bit and buy a new one. This one had the cool Union Jack on the roof - yesss! :-)No matter what money you are looking to spend in the under-$25K bracket, there are so many good choices. Don't even get me started on the Fit Sport, which isn't even here yet, or the new Golf which I so like the look of, also under $20K. Oh yeah, and my local dealer still has four '05 GTIs left, for which he is offering a $5000 discount across the board, which makes that model about $18K too - too bad all 4 are automatics. On principle I must look away...:-P "

Nice interior materials, excellent mid-range power, very comfortable car to drive on long trips. About 3 weeks after we took delivery (in 2000 when VWs were HOT -- Silver & Black Jettas were selling at sticker, while they discounted all other colors...Her's is White) she heard a whining from the car while accelerating. Brought it back to the dealer and they diagnosed it as a bad transmission. Sat there for 4 weeks until they could get a new transmission and install it. We should have gotten rid of the car then and there. There's always some kind of rattle, noise, or dash light illuminated. The ignition coils were replaced before VW issued the official recall (they did reimburse us). They went bad about 2 years later and the dealer wouldn't replace them free of charge, then tried to tell me that the entire front end was bad and would have to be replaced at a cost of about $4500!

The coolant leak may be from the expansion tank, near the electrical connector. I think there's a TSB on this. It's very important that coolant *not* get inside the electrical connector, as it can spread down to the car's main wiring harness if it does. The rubber seal around the electrical connector can be removed to ensure that any leaks in the tank spill on the ground instead of injecting pressurized coolant into the connector. Coilpacks? Surely you jest! The VR6 doesn't have coilpacks. Are you thinking of the spark plug wires? I had to replace those around 45,000 miles because they were arcing and causing a rough idle. "

When I gave the car back to the dealer (lease), the check engine light was on, and had been for the prior year. I got tired of fixing the same thing. If I listed out everything that went wrong with that car, you wouldn't believe me. Even as a fellow torched ex-VW owner, you wouldn't believe me. Suffice to say everything electrical in that car failed at least once, and that's both before and after the battery literally exploded. My favorite exchange went like this, though:Service guy: ""Mr. Perna, we changed the oil in your car, but I'm afraid we need to keep it another 30 minutes or so.""Me: ""What happened now???""Service guy: ""The radio won't turn back on. I'm not sure why, we only changed the oil."" They ended up replacing the entire head unit.

Oh, there is one more amusing thing that I nearly forgot.After my dad and I signed the paperwork and shook the hand of my salesman(my first new car!), I put some CDs in the Jetta's CD changer, and fired her up and drove off the lot. I literally made it a quarter mile down the road, and the changer started skipping like a madman.

"michaellno","April 2006"," Having owned a '99 New Beetle (2.0L gas, 5 speed GL trim level) for 6 years and 70,000 miles, I'm not sure if you could categorize us as ""lucky"" or ""very lucky"".Yes, we had a few problems - noticably, the power steering rack had to be replaced and there was some issue with the AC unit, but other than that, it was trouble-free. Wife and I drove it for the first 4 1/2 years, then our son drove it the last 18 months before we sold it.Would I buy another VW? Probably - we received pretty decent service from our local dealer, so I wouldn't be hesitant on that account. Other than the new GTI and the soon to be introduced Eos, VW doesn't make anything that I'm all that interested in - at an affordable price.When I bought my L300 3 years ago, I took a close look at the Passat. My requirements at the time were leather, V6 and an automatic transmission ... to get this in the Passat was going to run north of $26K. "
"woodyww","April 2006"," In between posts bashing VW's, I looked up the value of my 2000 bmw 528 wagon. Very depressing. NOW it's supposedly worth between $13.9, & $15.6. That's with 24K miles (add on for mileage), & the options, in ""Good"" condition. I paid $34K 4 1/2 years ago. Maybe I'm crazy, but ""losing"" $20K in depreciation, in 4 1/2 years, is a lot of bread, or cabbage.......for people who aren't rich, or super-yuppies. Oh well.I think......at this point, it's probably a great buy at $15-$16K for someone (?) if I sold it myself. Which probably means I should keep it. And: I don't want to jinx it, but the car has had almost Japanese car reliability.....The toyota shopping: 1. I could buy a loaded ""cute-ute"" new RAV4 for $28K something. They looked ""dinky"" to me, & I crossed it off my list. 2. New Red Solara convert., sticker around $31K: interior looked more Lexus-like. I was interested! 3. New FJ Cruiser in Black Cherry. Sticker was $33K something (W/o dealer add-ons), so I assume it was fully loaded(?) The vehicle looks as stunning in person as it does in the photos; altho probably totally impractical unless you do off-roading.However, I could see owning both a brand new Solara convert., AND a New FJ Cruiser. I bet the resale values would be excellent (?)..... Winter truck--off road, & a summer convert., both great looking, for $50-$60K brand new. It's not a bad fantasy.....if you had the $$ to blow. And would look great in my driveway! "
"british_rover","April 2006"," Well right now I just have the MINI and a Jeep Grand Cherokee that is my wifes car. We bought the Grand Cherokee for her this past fall so she would have a winter car since we moved up to New England. She has wanted a VW Cabrio ever since I met her but I have finaly convinced her not to get one cause they are too loud inside. She is hearing impaired and trying to have a conversation with her in a convertiable would be impossible. When the Eos comes out we will try that out and see if it is quiet enough being a hardtop.So right now just the Jeep and the MINI that I own but my demo is a 2002 Discovery that is doubles as the dealerships off road demonstration car. It was in a wreck and the frame was repaired which is a no no on a Disco since they have a fully boxed frame. We can't sell it because of that so I drive it most days and use it for off road test drives.When I moved up to New England I sold off my other two cars since I wouldn't have a place to put them up here.I sold my 1989 Pontiac Bonneville to a coworkers friend who had just had his car die. That was a great car even with 140,000 miles it still got above 35 mpg on the highway. It was my car left over from college and hardly ever drove it anymore anyway.I gave my 1979 Toyota Pickup to my mom since it would never be able to drive all the way to CT and she needed a little truck for yard work.Per resale on the MINI I killed the miles on mine and put over 24,000 miles on it in one year. I could turn around and sell it now pay off my note, was a five year term but I put about 20% down, and still pocket about five grand. "
"nippononly","April 2006"," No, I haven't priced out a Civic, except to know that the sticker of a 4-door EX would be about $19K, Honda dealers are a NOTORIOUS PITA when it comes to trying to negotiate a good price, fueled this year I AM SURE by the wildly successful sales of the Civic, and the seat is kinda narrow in the Civic. Compared to this, a Corolla S stick with moonroof and airbags and curtains stickers at about $18,1, and dealers have been telling me they could do $16K flat without fooling around. This is an old model at this point - four full years and counting to the replacement next spring. But if I decide to go this route, I will certainly test drive them back to back. I have access to fleet pricing for Hondas, which at least eliminates the haggling with those impossible people, if not actually getting me a great price. "
"sandman46","April 2006"," Went over to the nearby VW store on Sunday and saw what I'd really like, a 2004 Jetta. They had 4 of them, 2 silver, a white & a red. The silver with 21k miles really caught my eye, but being an almost 3 year old model and the reliability issues make me leery. And the other half would kill me, as she hates anything used. But I've really lusted over the 2004 model since they came out, particularly the dark gray color.Have a Sebring convertible tonite as the Sentra's back at Nissan with the service light on since Friday. But got a call that when the tech started it to drive to the back bay, the light was off. They kept it running for about an hour and drove about 10 miles and still no light. I still say they should replace the 4th coil, but they won't. And they also said that the computer didn't have any codes in it even with the light on since Friday. That I don't understand. I figured an error code would've been stored in the computer. Convinced them to keep it over night and start it up in the morning with the computer attached to the car, as it alwsys feels like it wants to tumble first thing in the morning. This is starting to get annoying now and eventhough it's fun to drive different rentals, I just want my car fixed and running like it did when new!The Sandman :mad: "
"corvette","April 2006"," Funny, my friend's Jetta is a dark gray 2004 (TDI), and my dad's Beetle is a 2003, also dark gray...My impression of Nissan is that they're pretty flexible. If the fourth coil (or something else) does go, after you've had CEL's under warranty, you can probably call Nissan USA and get it comped. The impression that I got when I was on the Altima boards was that they were at least a little flexible. But, if you have a dealer that really takes care of you, you probably won't have to call Nissan corporate to get it taken care of. "
"qbrozen","April 2006"," Yeah, that would have been the deal had I been able to sell my Lincoln privately. As it is, I'm quite a ways above $300, but I only put $800 down and rolled negative equity into it. Regardless, I'm still paying less per month AND saving alot of gas. "
"corvette","April 2006"," A couple of ways to look at that... One, you're driving a car that originally stickered for, I'm guessing, $40-45k new, and it's lost less than $5k per year in depreciation, which is less than the original owner lost, and it's poised to lose even less than that over the coming years.Two, I'm betting that while the 528i may be worth $14-16,000 as a used car, it's worth more than $14-16,000 to you. On a few unrelated points:I really like the looks of the FJ Cruiser. From what I can tell, when you activate four wheel drive, the stability control turns itself off, and can not be turned back on. This may be useful for off-roading, but if I'm in a snowstorm, I'm forced to choose between VSC and four wheel drive. I think this is a boneheaded move on the part of Toyota. While the FJ appeals to off-road enthusiasts, the majority of them will never be driven off road. The Solara coupe and convertible both look great. I haven't driven either, but you're right, if they put an ""L"" badge on them, I don't think I could call them out on it. Your 528 only has 24,000 total miles? How many miles when you bought it? You and mark156 seem to keep the mileage on your cars extremely low--this probably has something to do with their reliability. I'm nearing 13,000 miles in 10 months. I've always been committed to the idea of having one car at a time and driving it nearly everywhere I go, but my mileage has decreased from 25-30,000 miles per year to around 15,000. "

In fact, it has a mode where you can run in 4WD all the time, even on dry pavement, and I know the VSC is still on for that mode. And if you're in 4-LO, you should be doing some real low-speed stuff, at which time you really don't want the VSC on as it will strand you in low-traction situations. With 4-LO you've got the diff locks to get at least one wheel turning - you don't want the electronics meddling and throttling back because they sense a spinning wheel. The FJ is a great concept, but unfortunately it is a little too cute for regular folks like me. Not because I wouldn't buy a cute truck with serious offroad potential, but because its cute looks have caught the eye of every Tom, Dick, and Harry (and Jane), and I will never be able to find one for a good price. Or even one in stock at all, it seems. They are selling right off the truck in many cases. Anyway, I am keeping my new Runner for life, it's the last MY they made the stick.

He was disapointed but he walked the track and asked us the techinical specs on it and figured that the FJ could have done it now problem.What he ignored was the the entrance to the track is an aproximately 24 inch deep(measuring Crest to trough), 40 inch wide(measuring crest to crest) ditch.

"woodyww","April 2006"," corvette, yeah, there are a lot of ways to look at it. The way I'm looking at it right now, is as a cheapskate. And thinking that, $5k per year in depreciation is certainly not terrible, for an expensive Euro vehicle.

I still had my dear, departed, 1988 M6 then (I should have kept the M6, & bought a new Accord or something instead of selling the M6 & buying the 528iT).Wow, am I depressed now, I try not to think about the M6, even tho it needed $4k in suspension work when I sold it.But, what can you do with $15K or so, to replace a car like a mint-condition E39 bmw wagon? It would be different if it were having problems.......(knock wood!)*Two, I'm betting that while the 528i may be worth $14-16,000 as a used car, it's worth more than $14-16,000 to you.* "

That was the most frightening, noisiest, most uncomfortable vehicle I've ever been in. My memories could certainly be more fond than reality, but I swear that Wrangler was WAY more uncivilized than my '79 CJ (of course, to be fair, my CJ was modded to a great extent, including plush leather seats).

"perna","April 2006"," I have a soft spot for these - when I saw Toyota was bringing them back, I couldn't believe it. Overjoyed, really.My parents moved to Michigan in the mid-70s, and eventually ended up buying a house in the middle of nowhere. This house has a quarter-mile long driveway, and as such my old man needed something to plow it with. So, he bought a 1968 FJ (I knew them as ""Land Cruisers""). It performed admirably until '93-'94. The engine and transmission were fine, but was tired of plowing with the windows rolled down, because the entire exhaust system had rotted away. So, he gave it away before he had to have it towed.So, for the winter of 1994, what did he replace it with? A 1978 Toyota Land Cruiser. It looked essentially the same as the 1968 model, but this one had floor boards and you didn't have to worry about passing out from CO2 poisoning. Oh, and it was red with a white roof, while the '68 was baby blue all around (the parts that weren't completely rusted away, that is).When we went to the local auto show back in January, the old man was disappointed that they didn't have the new FJ on display. However, I don't think he really needs to be ""sold"" on one.""Don't tell your mother"", he told me at the show. ""But I'm going to order one this spring."" Most guys' fathers are into old muscle cars or boats - mine's into FJ Land Cruisers. "
"sandman46","April 2006"," Wouldn't you know it, when they restarted the car, the service light went off and stayed off no matter what they did. There was no code in the computer, so they said, & they let it run for a few hours and drove it about 20 miles and nothing. They even kept it overnight, as the problem always happens after sitting all night and all was fine this morning. Got the car back this afternoon and all appears well.While at the automall, sat in a new Civic & Accord. Gotta say, was more impressed with the Civic than the Accord. Looked at both the EX and LX and do prefer the EX with the bigger engine, 4 wheel disc brakes & 6 speaker stereo. It'll definitely fit into the garage also. Looks like it'll be between the Civic EX and the S40 with a time frame around the model change over in September, G-d willing.Funny, while sitting and looking at the Honda's, not 1 salesman came out the whole 15 minute time. It was a slow Tuesday afternoon around 5 PM and nothing. I really would've taken a test drive in the EX, LX & the Accord but finally decided to leave. Strange really. Will probaly stop by on my N/S day tomorrow if the weather's nice. Came home and told the wife and she's pretty convinced that I'll have a new ride by the fall...and she's probaly right.It'll be wonderful to buy a car I really want with no $ constraints...what a novel idea.

"nippononly","April 2006"," my Runner is the last-gen, not the current one - a 2000 model. 2000 is the last year Toyota offered a stick shift in the 4Runner, making it worth its weight in gold to me (although most people couldn't care less, I am sure, which is why Toyota dropped it). It's funny, the second gen ('90-'95) sold like 50% or more in stick shift, yet the third gen never sold many sticks at all. That probably represents the time period of the shift in the market from people using SUVs as trucks to people using SUVs as soccer-mobiles. The soccer moms and dads mostly want the automatic, I feel (and don't want 4WD anywhere near as much - there were a lot more gen-3 2Runners sold than gen-2's). hey sandman, the Civic EX now has the exact same engine as the LX, I believe.

But I think the load height of the RAV4 is lower in the back (for obvious reasons - the Runner is on a truck platform and is raised higher for off-pavement duties), so it gives the illusion of having more space - in fact strictly talking cubic feet, it may actually HAVE more room back there. But you can't load as long items as I can in my truck. And I don't have to stack everything to the roof to take advantage of the space. I know someone who has one of the new RAVs, and it was instantly clear on my first ride that this model continues the Toyota tradition of hard plastic interiors with precious little in the way of non-elbow-bruising areas, although it is certainly stylish in its own way.Me, I will take my truck, which is a leftover from the old-school at Toyota: lots of padded plastic and vinyl everywhere, no hard stuff anywhere, and lots of cloth on doors etc as well.

Or we can just go with the plan and trade her in.....we owe about what she's worth on trade.I would really like to keep her, but I'm not sure if that's a good move or not. Another option is to go ahead and get rid of her then buy a $1000 beater car to take her place.Right now Zippy needs tires, an alignment, and possibly a power steering pump (its leaking). Other than that there is nothing wrong with the car, cosmetically she's in pretty good shape for her age/miles (54k). "
"corvette","April 2006"," You might consider raising the deductible to $1000 before dropping to liability only. Either decision would depend on your ability to sustain a loss. If you keep Zippy long enough, it will eventually turn into a beater car, but that's after you've enjoyed the car's best years--and with 54k on the clock, you should still have a decent year (or three) left, depending on how quickly you rack up the miles. I thought you had an extended warranty on it until 100k? "
"nippononly","April 2006"," Don't get rid of it just to get a $1000 beater car. The car you've already got will treat you so much better, and there probably isn't that much money between the two is there?

"british_rover","April 2006"," A big Bronco? An old Bronco? Or one of those horribly Bronco IIs? "
"andre1969","April 2006"," I guess I should've specified which Bronco! My friend's is a '95 or so Eddie Bauer. Did these things have removeable roofs? My friend's looks like the roof is a separate piece, but on the inside it looks like you'd have to take off a bunch of trim and such to get to the bolts.Back in high school, a friend of mine had a '70's Blazer, and I think all you had to do was take off four bolts and the top lifted off. It was a two man job, though.I think the main reason I liked it was because it felt big and tought and up high, but with about 2 1/2 feet less rear end than my pickup. Hardly the most maneuverable thing to be cruising around on the streets of DC with, but it was still fun!I'm sure this is just a passing fad with me, though. I always liked those old 60's Broncos, too. "
"british_rover","April 2006"," Some Full sized broncos did have removable roofs but I think by 1995 that had been phased out of production.Those old full size broncos aren't bad vehicles but finding one in good shape now would probably be hard.One of my friends in HS had one that was passed down to him from his Dad. His dad was a VMI graduate and very, very meticulous about everything. It was in great shape and he used it all through HS and college. I think it finally got wrecked and totalled not long after he graduated. "

"andre1969","April 2006"," there was a story in the Baltimore Sun where a guy in a Bronco was trying to evade the police, and hit a Caprice police cruiser head-on. This was one of the 90's whale-Caprices.It was anything BUT a low-speed chase! The Bronco pretty much ceased to exist ahead of the firewall. But worse, it rode up over the Caprice, which was just about obliterated to the C-pillar. The Bronco driver was unhurt, but the officer died instantly.I wonder if an old Blazer would satisfy my Bronco-type vehicle craving? I found a 1986 Blazer not too far away. Cheap, but needs work. I guess if nothing else, if it ended up being too much of a junker, I could cannibalize parts off of it for my Silverado! :shades: "

She's small, 2-door, no a/c, no c/c. But darn she's a great little car.She does have the balance of the 5 year/100k powertrain warranty (hubby canceled the other warranty while I was gone). Other than the stuff I listed there's nothing wrong with her unless you count the broken windshield......dang rocks!I was offered $6500 3 weeks ago not on trade but selling to a used car dealer, so I guess that's about what she's worth wholesale. The dealer did comment that my car was in better shape for its age/miles than most of the Focus he sees come through even the ones with lower miles.

I was thinking it was worth more like $4500......(in the Lower 48)..... "
"akangl","April 2006"," I had it appraised at 2 used car dealers and both of them said they would buy it for $6500 or I could consign it and probably see $7500 (they put it on the lot for $8495 and take $995) or I could sell it on my own for $8000. I don't know how much the books have dropped in the past 3 weeks, but that's what they said then. The only catch was I had to replace the windshield ($250). I questioned them a couple times and mentioned that I thought that was high, but the one dealer said he had a 2004 Focus on his lot with 12k on it and he was asking $9995 so he felt he was in line with mine.I have seen several used Focus on lots that are more miled up than mine and in much worse shape for about the same amount of $$$. They are a pretty popular car up here, go figure.Only reason I didn't sell it was because I was still undecided.I asked the UCM at the dealer we are dealing with on the new truck what he was thinking as far as trade on my Titan, he said he figures around $19k for it and $6k for Zippy. That is providing the books don't dump between now and the time the new truck gets here. "
"michaellno","April 2006"," The parents of one of my daughters friends has a last gen Bronco (I think early 90's).I've only seen it a couple of times, but from a distance it looks to be the cleanest Bronco in the state of Colorado. However, I have heard via the friend that they've had a few mechanical issues with it.Of course, they totally ruined it by plastering Pittsburgh Steeler stickers and what-not all over the back. That, I can tell you, does not go over well here in the land of the Broncos (exhibit 1 would be the latest AFC Championship game in January).A buddy of mine in college back in the 80's owned a mid-70's Blazer. Even though we lived in Phoenix, he claimed never to have had the roof removed. Drove it from PHX to California and back during one school break. Bouncy bouncy bouncy went the ride.Jolie, I'm pretty sure I can get 8-9K for my Focus in trade, but I know it's a bit more loaded than yours. Must be those inflated Alaska pricing forces at work again.... "
"nippononly","April 2006"," Those Alaskan prices are amazing! I also change my opinion: sell sell sell! I am shocked you can get $6500 for a 55K-mile Focus without A/C, but there is no question you should then. I still don't know about buying a beater though. What ISN'T beater duty on roads that aren't paved all the way to the house? And it is so likely to become a money pit - believe me, I have had more than my share. Better to use the money putting diesel in your new HD pick-up, and enjoy driving a new ride. :-)As for Broncos, they have to be the toughest covered truck around, but I don't know about those later models right before it got discontinued. I had a friend of a friend who used to spend about equal amounts of time telling us how much he loved his early 90s model and cursing it loudly every time something new broke. I think CR agrees with that general sentiment - the basic foundation is very solid, but everything else is constantly breaking down. Plus they guzzle gas even more than other gas guzzlers - that friend's friend used to take four of us up to the snow, and we had to put like $100 of gas in it going there and back, which is way more than even other SUVs.

I only paid $11k for Zippy when she was new.The decision hasn't been totally made yet, but I think Zippy will be leaving. Its either payoff Zippy and keep her or cut her loose and buy a wood fired boiler to heat the house (read: no high fuel bills, wood is free for us).I'm sending out the deposit for the new truck in the morning. I have been amazed at how easy this deal has been, 2% over invoice with no arguement (not so at other dealers), ordered the truck, took all of 15 minutes. Very easy dealership to do business with no doubt there. The internet manager who has been handling it is an awesome guy, very easy to deal with. I'm super happy with the deal, probably the easiest I've ever done. Now if 2 months would just hurry the heck up!!!!Diesel trucks have been commanding crazy $$$ up here, Ford dealers won't go under 3% over, one Dodge dealer won't go under MSRP, Chevy dealers seem to really love thier trucks.

But CPO status boosts the asking price, which makes folks with an itchy trigger finger like me have to wait longer to trade again, OR roll negative equity.

I've seen one run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week only stopping for fuel and oil changes until it reached one-million miles The Engineers said that's good enough and turned the truck offThe show was on TLC and they examined the engine and it showed very mild wear. Don't you hate when you are wrong. :P I sure do and have been proven wrong a few times on this site. It happens to the best of us. Dodge has changed the Cummins about 4 times since 1989 and they have NOT changed to a different diesel, its always been the 5.9L I-6 Cummins. Ford has changed their diesel 4 times over the years but it was always made by International. As I explained GM has only changed the engine twice. I also want to note the Duramax is a gem as far as sophistication. I believe it only uses 6 quarts of oil, while the others use atleast 12. It has and always will be more powerful than the competition and get's signifactly better gas mileage than the other 2. :P GM used to have some great engines, the 5.7L V8 and 7.4L V8 come to mind, then they changed to the 5.3L V8, 6.0L V8, and 8.1L V8, along with that they got the piston slap and numourous other problems. The new Vortecs are more fuel effcient, more powerful, and can haul/tow alot more than their predacessors. :confuse:I don't know anyone who has this so called piston slap. They might be using a low quality gasoline, and if the dummy's read their owners manuels, the 6.0 is designed to run on 91 octane to reach maximum power figures but can still run on 87. Our regular grade gas down here is a lousy watered down 86 octane, and that just isn't enough octane. :mad:As far as the Titan goes, its a good truck for what it is, a 1/2 ton.

"nippononly","April 2006"," and......I live in California, so no VW diesels are an option for me. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the new Camry hybrid is equipped in every way exactly the same as a Camry XLE 4-cyl. Which is to say, you want the moonroof, you got the moonroof. Ditto the folding rear seat, I believe - don't quote me on that one! :-) "
"guss","April 2006"," to get the hybrid Camry you have to get the top of the line Camry. Not very economical in my opinion for those thinking of saving money.I'm thinking for the cost the current generation Corolla would be the best bang for your buck right now. Get it before the redesign comes out and get a bit of a discount and still get 35 mpg. "
"nippononly","April 2006"," from what I've heard, the Camry hybrid is not like Toyota hybrids of the past - the price will actually slot in BETWEEN the prices of the 4-cyl and 6-cyl Camrys. You are correct, though, that it has a high level of standard equipment, if that's what you meant. It will cost thousands more (about 5, I believe) than the least expensive 4-cyl Camry. "
"corvette","April 2006"," I think CARB allows you to bring a TDI in from out of state if it has more than 7500 miles on it. "
"akangl","April 2006"," One of the firefighter's has a VW Jetta TDI, its a 2004 I believe. He drives 250 miles to work one way. He's had the car for just over a year I think and has put over 40k miles on it. He's had no trouble with it at all, says its a great car even on the worst of roads.The 2 VW's I had were pretty good cars too. I don't think all VWs are bad, its just a crapshoot with them, kinda like some other vehicles out there. "
"nippononly","April 2006"," I think you're right, but I was kinda hoping to go new rather than used with the next purchase. After I dismissed that Civic HX from my list, of course! ;-)In the used market, there are actually VW diesels that were originally sold new in California.

"woodyww","April 2006"," You want to get better than the 40 mpg you're getting with your Echo, is that right?

What if you threw safety into the mix......& maybe took out the stick shift requirement? Is the Prius bigger/safer than the Echo? One of the reasons I considered a Prius for a while was the hatch/cargo area/fold down rear seats. "
"rockylee","April 2006"," Woody,Isn't the prius much safer to ?Rocky "
"nippononly","April 2006"," The Echo gets five stars all the way around for crash ratings, as far as I know. At the time, it was rated safer than the same-year Camry - the Toyota PR flacks were very proud of that fact, and very eager to point it out whenever they were asked (and sometimes when they weren't!). Today's generation of cars, the majority with side impact airbags and curtains, would do better I am sure. Back then, the Camry didn't have side curtains yet. But my Echo did better than everything else in its class from the time.Now, as for its fuel economy, look what topic we are in! I'm not looking for good reasons to keep the car!! :-PBut I think you're right that I'm not likely to do any better in fuel economy without making the move to a hybrid or a diesel. And neither of those is in my near future, so I am going to have to satisfy my CCB urges some other way. Now, how to do that..... :confuse: "
"stickguy","April 2006"," IIRC, you can't compare different size cars to each other based on the stars. The stars are based on comparisons to other cars in the class. So, a 4 star minivan or mid size sedan might be ""safer"" than a 5 star subcompact.I get confused with all the different rating systems, so this might not apply accorss the board, but I remember discussing this at some point.

"michaellno","April 2006"," Here in Denver, one of the local Nissan dealerships has had a change of ownership. To promote this, they have been doing lots of TV advertising for Altima leases for $79/mo.Yes, that's right, only $79 per month.I had taken yesterday off to play some golf and it turns out that this dealer happened to be between where I live and where I played, so I decided to make a quick stop to see what the catch was.Here's what the greenpea (2 whole weeks on the job!) told me:Altima 2.5S w/ stick shift, no options - MSRP approx $20K)$2000 down24 months24,000 milesEPA 24 city, 31 highwayLease deal is through NMACThe 2.5S has power everything, keyless remote, cruise, AM/FM/CD stereo and A/C. Compared to the Focus that I drive currently, the only things I would be giving up are ABS, alloy wheels and 1 MPG on the highway rating. On the other hand, the Altima has a 20 gallon gas tank so I could go further on a tank before having to refill - when I refill the Focus it's anywhere between 10 and 11 gallons to fill it.I have 22 payments of $321/mo on the Focus before it's paid off.I'm thinking of giving him a call and asking him for the residual amount and the money factor and running some numbers. I'm still not sure how they can get the lease payment down so low, even with an invoice sales price and a rebate - I need to check those numbers out on Edmunds.Thoughts? "
"qbrozen","April 2006"," seems like a screaming deal (pun not quite intended). Heck, why not put down $3600 and have 0 payments for 24 months? "

They mention an initial payment, which in this case would be $2309. But then they say ""tax extra"". If you're leasing a car though, what do you pay taxes on? Do you still pay a sales tax on a negotiated price?At a quick glance, I didn't think this sounded half bad. After all, my Intrepid was $2000 down, and then the monthly payment was $347.66. Of course, I bought that car, so I could put as many miles as I wanted to on it. Nowadays though, I could probably keep the miles down to 12,000 per year pretty easily. "
"guss","April 2006"," in Pennsylvania you pay the regular sales tax(6%) plus an additional 3 % on your monthly payment.So on your example it would be $209 plus tax of $18.81 a month. "
"stickguy","April 2006"," A deal to be sure. DO the math, and it is about equivalent to $164/month with nothing down (that is, spread the DP of 2K over 24 months). Hard to go wrong for that if it fits your needs.I would be tempted to get one myself if it was a year from now, when my son turns 16 and is going to learn to drive. Get the stick shift initiation done on a car that I won't have for a long time, so all the clutch slipping and gear grinding won't bother me!I actually plan to get an older semi-beater for him to learn on (and then serve as the spare car), but it might cost less overall (depreciation and repairs) to lease something in this price range instead, although insurance will be higher (since I live in NJ, probably by a lot!) "
"michaellno","April 2006"," Here in Colorado, sales tax is geography dependant - state sales tax, county sales tax, city sales tax, transportation district, stadium district, etc, etc, etc.The sales tax is added to the monthly lease amount and shows up on your statement, so the money down is cap cost reduction, security deposit and acquisition fee, as was described above. Registration is also handled on a county by county basis, so the dealer sends your county the sales information and you then pay the county directly to get your tags.andre, the advertised vehicle is not the ""special edition"" but a regular 2.5S with mats and splash guards. The special edition includes a half-dozen other options that escape me at the moment. "
"stickguy","April 2006"," sort of like the bait in a bait and switch. The ad price gets you in, then you find out it doesn't have an automatic, etc. So, they try to upsell you into a more expensive lease.But, if this has everything thing you need, you get lucky. "
"michaellno","April 2006"," Funny you should mention insurance. After leaving the dealership, I called my State Farm agent to see what a new car would do to my rates.In addition, with a kid going off to college in the fall, it was a good opportunity to find out if her relocation would have an impact on the premiums. On that matter, the answer was no, since she will be attending school within 150 miles of the primary residence.What I did find interesting is that the kid is currently rated on the Focus but really drives the L300. I was under the impression that the premiums on the Focus were less - WRONG! If we switch her to the L300, the premium drops by about $25/month, which is good news to the kid since she pays her own insurance.Then, I would be rated on the Focus, but would trade that in for the Altima ... pretty much a wash as far as the premium goes - $75/month, give or take a few bucks.Wife says if I want a new car, I should get it. She has always liked the Altima, and in fact lobbied for it when I bought the L300 3 years ago. The L was several thousand less, however (I was looking for a V6 with leather and a sunroof at the time) and Saturn was also offering 0% financing as well. "
"woodyww","April 2006"," If you like the car--enough--heck at that price if you just didn't ""hate it"" even, it sounds like a great deal.

"
"michaellno","April 2006"," Edmunds TMV on the trade in value of the Focus is $7300 .. I think I owe just under $7K, so maybe a few hundred dollars in equity there.Of course, NADA pegs the trade in value at $9500, which is a number I like a lot better, but is probably unrealistic.Invoice on the Altima (2.5S with mats and splash guards) is $19,153. $1750 rebate exists; this takes the transaction price to $17,403.woodyvw - what's not to like? Not much, really. I'm a bit nervous about having to live with a mileage allotment. We're considering a move to the country and that would add lots of miles to my daily commute. I asked the wife if she would be willing to drive it as we would be a lot closer to her work after the move - she sorta said yes.Other than that, I can't see too much of a downside. A new, larger car that gets approximately the same mileage as the car I'm currently driving, with the same features and is under warranty for $100-200 less per month on the payment. "
"andre1969","April 2006"," that bugs me about the 4-cyl Altima is its relatively poor highway EPA rating. I would go with an automatic myself, which is rated at 23/29. I guess it just bugs me because an equivalent Accord/Camry is rated at 24/34.Most of my driving is local though, so I guess I should focus more on the fact that the city estimate is only 1 mpg less, and that the highway difference wouldn't affect me that often. My Intrepid is rated at 20/29, so in theory the Altima shouldn't do any worse on the highway, and might give me about a 15% improvement in most of my driving. "
"akangl","April 2006"," Heck I'd go for it, that's a great payment on a lease. For me leasing doesn't work (as told by the 50k miles in 17 months on my Titan), but if it works for you then by all means jump on it.Make sure you update us when you bring your new car home.  "
"perna","April 2006"," I think the Altima's 4 banger has a few more horsies than the Toy/Honda equivalent, which sort of explains the difference in mileage. My folks had a mid-90s Altima with a 4cyl, and that thing got up and went! "
"andre1969","April 2006"," if another thing holding back the Altima 4's mileage is that it has a 4-speed auotmatic, compared to the 5 speed automatics that the Camry and Accord 4-cyl have.When the Camry 4-cyl went from a 4-speed to 5-speed automatic in 2005 (IIRC), the EPA estimates went up slightly, from 23/32 to 24/34. And when the Altima V-6 got a 5-speed automatic, it saw a pretty healthy boost from 19/26 to 20/30!My Mom & stepdad have a '99 Altima, and I don't really like it. I liked that first-gen ('93-97?) Altima though. I thought it was a good looking car. Never had a chance to drive one though. "
"bumpy","April 2006"," I liked that first-gen ('93-97?) Altima though.Yep, the U13 was one of the better renditions of the '90s 'jellybean' fad. I still see them around all the time. The 1993 had a little pad-printed ""Stanza"" badge over by the left tail light. If Nissan had brought over the AWD turbo version, we could have had a proper ""Altima SE-R"" a decade early. "
"nippononly","April 2006"," Shoot, that's pretty amazing. I imagine it's because the new one is coming along pretty soon, right?I would consider something like that, and just pay the whole lease up-front. But I am sure I would exceed the mileage allowance. What's the cost per mile over the allowance? "
"michaellno","April 2006"," The EPA numbers on the sticker of the Altima that I looked at were 24 city, 31 highway. The EPA numbers for the Focus ZX5 that I am driving are 25 city, 32 highway. I average about 29-31 MPG in my normal driving - my daily 20 mile commute is about 3 miles of neighborhood driving (25-35MPH), 5 miles of divided 4 lane road (45-60MPH), and about 12 miles of interstate (65-75MPH).More numbers to bore you with:The Altima has a 2.5 litre, 175 horsepower engine; the Focus is 2 litres and 130 HP. The curb weight of the Altima is 3075 pounds (17.57 lbs per hp), while the curb weight of the Focus is 2699 pounds (20.76 lbs per hp).The size of the fuel tank - 20 gallons for the Altima, 13.2 gallons for the Focus.I dunno .. I think I am having a case of 'analysis paralysis'. I think I will call the dealer and get the residual percentage and money factors and go from there. EDIT: the mileage penalty is, I believe, .15 per mile. I can get those details as well. "
"andre1969","April 2006"," is probably about right. That was the same penalty on the Altima lease I dug up.Back when my buddy bought his '98 Tracker, he got talked into one of those ""smart buy"" things, where you had 47 monthly payments and then on the 48th month you could either turn it in or pay off a balloon payment. The kicker is that if you went over on miles, they hit you with 10 cents per mile, I think it was back then.Well, he was 30,000 miles over, so he had a choice of turning it in and paying $3,000, and having NO vehicle, or paying $5600 and keeping it. He chose to keep it. And naturally, the transmission went out soon thereafter.  "
"nippononly","April 2006"," is not too bad - say I exceeded the mileage limit by 10K, that would be $1500 over the life of the lease, or an extra $62.50/month, which still seems like an OK deal to me for a brand new Altima - that would be like $225/mo with nothing down. It's a lot of car at that price. "
"akangl","April 2006"," For the mileage penalty. My Titan is leased through NMAC and the mileage penalty on it is 15 cents/mile. Can you imagine what mine would be at the end of 48 months??? :sick: Probably somewhere around $13k if I kept up my current rate of driving.......roughly 34k/year. Residual on the truck is $17,183-$2310 (refunded ESC that became a deposit), so $14,873 to buy the truck at the end of the lease. If I was keeping it I would no doubt have to buy it and eat it. OUCH! "
"steine13","April 2006"," ... Back in the day, when leasing was young.... say, '98 or so... the mileage penalties were often 10 cents/mile. Even on big rigs like Tahoes or Gd Cherokees or other semi-upscale 'utes.This was back when they were hot.So you had residuals that later turned out to be overinflated by thousands -- average loss for lenders on returned SUVs was $4-5k, IIRC -- and then, to add insult to injury, you had mileage penalties that in no way made up for the loss in value of these miled-up trucks. Ah, to be young and foolish again.Anyway, what do youze guyze think it costs to drive? $.15/mile sounds a little high but OK; 10 cents is a steal. In fact, I've often paid 10 cents a mile on old cars I bought used, when figured over the life of the vehicle.I'd say the lease deal on the Altima is great, even with penalty... if you stay in the warranty mileage for 24 months, what's not to like... lotsa car, and someone else's worries.

Considering that was from 253,000-338,000 miles though, I guess that's not too bad!

They used a Jeep Commander with a Hemi as their photography vehicle, and got 17.2 MPG on the highway. What was shocking was that the Commander, with all its heft, only has a 20.5 gallon fuel tank. My Altima had a 20 gallon tank! Surprisingly, the Commander with a Hemi doesn't have the shortest range of the Jeep lineup. That honor goes to the Grand Cherokee SRT, which has the same size (20.5 gallon) tank, and achieves 12 MPG city, 15 highway--at best, you'll be stopping every 300 miles for fuel. One more point... The Commander is available with the fuel-sipping 3.7-liter V6. A base 4x4 weighs nearly two and a half tons! I'd almost like to test drive one just to see for myself how horribly underpowered it is.

"woodyww","April 2006"," I had a '98 Range Rover 4.6 with a 24.6 gallon tank. I got 300 miles per tank-full, period. It was slightly depressing filling it up even then (altho the fuel costs were dwarfed by the other costs of owning a LR). I sold it about 4 1/2 years ago--I can't even imagine buying fuel for it now. Wait, $73.80 now to fill up & go 300 miles.....I think it was $35 in 2001.You'd think--since Chrysler puts Cummins Diesels in their P/U's, they'd be putting them in their SUV's. But the Soccer Moms (& Dads) probably wouldn't understand it, or buy it. It may take gas going to $5.....(?) But I agree with your point about the tank size.FWIW, the current Accord has a 17 gallon tank, & the Prius, 11.9.....so it now costs $35 to totally fill up a Prius (!), but it can go 480 miles or so.

"woodyww","April 2006"," Good point about the Cummins. I guess my point is--maybe like yours--whether it's a Cummins, or another brand of diesel, or some type of hybrid--it may be the only way people can afford to run large trucks/suvs at some point.I agree about Mercedes diesels. I'd be tempted to look for a used diesel E300/320 now, but I'm guessing they're scarce, & or pricey. I almost bought a new 280CD in 1979. Kind of odd to have a diesel in a 2 dr. coupe, but it would be great to have more of those kinds of choices..... I think in Europe 1/2 of all vehicles are diesel powered(?).It kind of stinks that Americans don't have more access to diesels......like the bmw x5, or diesel bmw's in general. And if M-B is merged with Chrysler, & the Cummins isn't suitable for SUV's, why can't we have M-B diesels in Chryslers? "
"british_rover","April 2006"," They do in Europe.You can get a Grand Cherokee with a MB diesel in Europe but becasue our diesel fuel in the use is very dirty the MB diesel cannot run on it.ULSD(Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel) is on its way now and is slowly being phased in across the country. Once it is widely avaliable you will see a few more diesels from Europe come over.Not long after that I would hope there would be a surge in popularity for diesel cars and SUV's.I also agree about the cummins it is much to large and complex for an SUV. It is much much to heavy for such a light weight vehicles as the Jeep. Would not even fit in the engine bay.Maybe if they cut the cummins in half and made it a four cylinder it would be ok.  "
"andre1969","April 2006"," how can you pass it up?Well, I forced myself to do yardwork and other stuff outside on Saturday, so I didn't have a chance to get on eBay and fret over that St. Regis.I did email the seller on Friday though, asking him if he had any other pics. He replied, saying that he wouldn't be able to get to the car until Monday, as it's in the repair shop about 50 miles away. He also said that he had two solid offers on it and expected it to be gone today.So I'm guessing that means it'll either show up on eBay again, or it'll show up this year at Carlisle with some overly inflated price on it.The past two cars I've bought from eBay, a '79 New Yorker and '76 LeMans, were both cars that didn't make their reserve OR buy it now price. I had emailed both sellers after the fact, and we worked out a price.I guess I could try the same thing with this St. Regis.

The four cylinder might be better. It would be a little shorter then the 4.0 inline 6 cylinder that the Jeeps used to get and probably only a little bit heavier.I bet horsepower would be about the same at around 200 horsepower since the full sized cummins motor makes 325 horsepower. Torque would probaby be in the low 400 range or tuned for a little less since that much torque might overpower the rest of the drivetrain.I have no idea what MPG would be though.

"ghulet","May 2006"," Personally, I can't see spending ~$10-13k on a ten year-old Mercedes diesel mostly in an effort to save on fuel costs (aka 'money'). If fuel ($) savings were actually your main goal, why not just buy a new Fit/Scion/Corolla/Civic/Yaris and have a warranty to boot? If having the MB name/status or a car that large aren't 'musts', I don't see any benefit. You could also pick up a newish Taurus or Impala, if you wanted a mid-sizer, with some warranty left for the same price, though re-sale wouldn't be the same. Still, a new or two-year old car versus ten years old holds obvious benefits.Oh jeez, I sat in the back seat of a Jeep Commander at the Chicago Auto Show--awful. I hit my head going in (I'm 6'0"", 180-ish, 32-34"" inseam, not particularly long in the torso nor legs), despite the boxy doors, and had no legroom; it reminded me of the LR Discovery. "

"michaellno","May 2006"," Back in January, my FIL passed away. He owned a '92 Legacy L AWD wagon with about 135K on it. At the time, my wife let her sister keep the car, since she doesn't own one.

Instead, we might take it off her hands and sell one of our other cars.It's purple, stick shift and pretty well loaded - AC, Cruise, PW, PDL, PM. When I drove it (briefly) in January, it needed some exhaust work and there was a small problem with the door locks - I think the drivers door wouldn't lock at all.My thinking is that before doing anything I would take it to a mechanic and have them check out the car from stem to stern and see what needs to be addressed now, and what kinds of things to expect in the next 6-12 months.If I sold the Focus, I could get a bit of profit out of it and save the $321/mo in payments.

After 24 months of Altima lease payments, I would still owe something like $11-13K if I were to buy it or I would have nothing and need a new car.Second, I've averaged about 1300-1400 miles per month on the Focus. With the lease, I'd rack up a grand or two in mileage charges.Maybe it's the fact that I'm starting to think logically about my financial decisions .. God knows I didn't do that nearly enough 7/10/15 years ago.So, while I want a new set of wheels, I don't necessary need them.

"michaellno","May 2006"," While I don't disagree with either of you in principle regarding the Altima, there are larger agendas in play.The wife and I have been thinking about a new house, and after many, many months of looking, we might have found something that we both like. To pull the trigger this fall and move in next spring - the house is in a new development - we'd have to do a bit of rearranging with the cash flow, so standing pat with car payments (or, ditching the Focus and driving the FIL's inhereted Subaru for a while) might be the way to go.The good news is that even if I do nothing, we'll still free up almost $1000/mo by the end of next year - no more child support payments and the Saturn L will be paid for. OTOH, I do have a kid going off to college this fall, and we don't have a clear picture of what those costs are going to be.My latest plan (as of 2PM MDT today) involves selling the Focus, driving the Subaru around for a 12/18/24 months, then selling the Subaru outright and getting a frugal commuter car like a Yaris or Fit.Regarding the CTS lease, I've seen some ads for that as well. The details that I've seen are that it's a 39 month lease and .25/mile in excess of 32,500 miles (10K per year, just as au1994 says).Given that I live in a semi-rural area about halfway between Denver and Colo Springs, there is no way a 10K per year lease would work. In the leases that we've had in the past, 15K was barely enough. Each car averages 16-18K per year - mine with the commute, the wifes because we use it as the 'vacation' vehicle. "

Its no doubt fixable and since my brother works at a junkyard which happens to have another 97 Sebring as a donor so parts aren't a problem.I'm probably picking it up on Saturday (have to go get our car hauler trailer first) and hauling it up to my brother, he's going to look at it, then we'll go from there. Damage is limited to the driver's side rear quarter panel and that rear tire (suspension is bent). Airbags are blown also.According to what I know about it the car runs fine with no prior issues. If I can get it fixed and going for under $1000 I'll probably take it. Cheap car that should get decent gas mileage and go for a while.

I spotted an '03 Altima 2.5s 5-speed in the local auto shopper with only 30k miles for $12,999 at a Saturn dealer. It got me thinking again about trading my 2 cars, lowering my monthly payment, getting cash out of the deal, AND getting much better gas mileage. And, of course, getting back into a manual transmissioned car, which I sorely miss.edit: ok, scratch that ""much better mileage"" bit. I'm amazed to learn that the 2.5s is only rated at 23/29. So I'd probably average only about 5 mpg better than my V8 Lincoln. Not exactly the stellar jump I was imagining for a lighter, less luxurious car with FAR less power. "

"qbrozen","May 2006"," Well, I've been mulling over the numbers and it just doesn't look good in this particular instance.Do all of us CCB'ers get this detailed?Anyway, I figured the gas savings of the Altima in question over my Lincoln would amount to about $50/mo (at current prices). A 4-year loan on the Altima would be about $100/mo cheaper (I have 4.5 years left on the Lincoln). SO, we're looking at $150/mo savings.HOWEVER, in order to do this, I'm trading in 2 cars and walking away with maybe $3k cash. Even if I firesale my Volvo, I should get $4500 out of it on the street. SO, in essence, the 2-for-1 trade is costing me $1500 out-of-pocket. It would take me almost a year to recoup that initial loss. Just doesn't seem worth it.On the other hand, I have also been pondering still selling the Volvo outright and THEN selling the Lincoln outright (i could get what I owe) and starting from scratch.

I would have to pay a small amount for the county registration and plates (something like $30, I think), plus whatever amount of money it would take to get the car into decent condition.As I mentioned, it needs some exhaust work ... one of the two tailpipes has rusted off at the rear muffler so it sounds really loud at the moment. I would also have a complete inspection done to see what else needs to be done and what kinds of things I could expect to fail in the next year or two .. if it's not too many things, then we'd do those repairs and keep it.

In an ideal world, I would love to have a car to commute in, a car for vacations (wife's VUE would suffice in this role) and a fun car for weekends.Ironically, the house we are thinking of does include a 3 car garage, so there would be space to park a toy should one find its way into our lives.

"qbrozen","May 2006"," Budget was exactly the problem. Back when I bought the Z, it made sense to get the pure sportscar. When it became necessary to trade it, I decided on a max budget of $20k, which ruled out any used G35 I could find (and, yes, I was looking for a 6-speed, which is akin to a hen's teeth).But, on a side note, I would NEVER call something as ugly as the G35 sedan a Z of any configuration. Not only did the Z stir great driving passion in me, I drooled everytime I looked at it in my garage. "
"woodyww","May 2006"," In my experience, the cars ""that inspire passion"", are either very impractical, very expensive, &/or have big maintenence bills. But if you can afford one as a 2nd car, can be worth it.My amateur advice: enjoy the Lincoln for what it is, & enjoy the memories of the Z. It's very tough being a car nut, & not being able to afford to own (at the same time) at least 2-3 cars that really Turn You On.....it drives me crazy sometimes.*I just don't feel passionate about it like I did my Z.* "
"nippononly","May 2006"," KBB, my truck which was already six (model) years old in January, has since dropped FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS in value, or approximately 29%. That's in four months, on a vehicle that was already more than 5 years old? That sucks, and has to be unprecedented. I have driven it about 4000 miles in that time. I only just bought it, so the payments are nowhere near done (originally 4 years to pay, I have been accelerating the payments), and basically this means that a vehicle I was right-side-up in at Christmas now has me upside-down in the loan? Something is very wrong there. The money I put down has vanished. :-(Clearly there won't be any trades for me in the near future - I had told myself I would not trade the Echo until I had a very comfortable margin in the 4Runner, which now looks like it may be a year out.

I'm thinking it would be nice to have a fun car, a people hauler (van/SUV), a cargo hauler (pickup), and a reliable, cheap-to-operate sedan. I could also see the need for a luxury barge on occasion.

"andre1969","May 2006"," I don't need a garage, I need a pole barn.And a shrink... Mathias, if you do decide on a pole barn, here's the url for the company that built mine.Here's some pics of mine, in various stages of construction. It's finished now, except for painting, gutters, and hooking up the electric. They ran an underground line from the back of the garage to the house, so now I just need to get an electrician to come out one of these days and finish it off.Originally I wanted to go with a loft, but the county struck me down because it would've exceeded their height requirement. But then, as soon as I had new plans for a building drawn up, minus the loft, they changed their standard. By that time I was too irritated to go back and change again, though. Probably a good thing too, because the money I saved losing the loft more than paid for all the gravel I had to bring in for that driveway, and other little unforseen things that popped up.As for a shrink, can't help ya on that one. I tend to run the other way when I see the men in white with the big butterfly nets. :shades: "

Then again ... if you're gonna do it, do it right, right?  "
"andre1969","May 2006"," I ended up getting a 24x40 building. The whole thing ended up running close to $28-30K I'm guessing, once it was all said and done. The pole barn company's part of it was around $15K. Mine ran more than what the online prices show because I got a regular roof with shingles and plywood (well, that pressed stuff actually) instead of a metal roof. Also, I think the T-111 siding was more expensive than metal siding, but I'm not sure. I also ended up getting 5 windows, one entry door, and two single garage doors, which ran the price up a bit. I can't remember how many of each they threw into the ""base"" package.Then, the real fun part was dealing with the county. The pole barn company's plans for the foundation just included a footer pad that the poles would rest on, and compact fill, such as crushed gravel or something like that, around them. The county made me dig bigger holes, with wider, thicker footer pads, crushed gravel underneath the pads, and concrete instead of compacted fill around the poles.Then there was the floor. I lost track of how many truckloads of gravel I had to have brought in, for both the driveway and under the concrete floor. They also found an underground spring about 30-40 feet out in front of the garage doors, so that had to get dug up, have some big rocks/recycled concrete/bricks/etc dumped down in, and then gravel put back over. I forget now how long the driveway extension ended up being, but the guy said he ran about 175 feet of cable from the garage to the house, so I'd guess the driveway was close to that as well.To do the concrete floor in the garage, I think it took something like 14-15 cubic yards. And concrete ain't cheap these days. I haven't gotten four cars in it yet, but for the time being have my '79 New Yorker (221.5"") and my '76 LeMans (~208"") on one side, one behind the other, and there's a few feet between the NYer and the garage door, and just enough room for me to squeeze between the two cars, and between the LeMans and the wall. I have my '67 Catalina on the other side, by itself for now. I left my '57 DeSoto over at my grandmother's place, because I'm going to have a guy do some brake work on it. He recommended doing it over there, instead of having it bleed brake fluid all over my nice, new concrete floor.If I had it to do over again, I think I would've tried to see if they could've built me a custom size, like 40x27 feet. Even though the cars fit in fine, that extra 3 feet would give me a bit more room on the sides for shelves, toolboxes, storage, etc, and still be able to swing the car doors fairly wide.40x27 is the biggest they would let me go. They have this silly little ordinance that no secondary buildings can be larger than the primary. Well, my house really has about 1500 square feet, but they consider it a 1 1/2 story house, so they only count half of the square footage upstairs. And I have an enclosed room on one side that they don't count, either. So it's assessed at 1106 square feet.I guess I shouldn't complain too much, though. At least that lower square foot assessment on the house keeps my property taxes a bit lower.Oh well, I guess if I need more space, I can always build another one!  "

"woodyww","May 2006"," I owned a used 1986 Toyota P/U for 3 years starting around 1989. I got about 1/2 of what I paid when I sold it. (I only paid $4500, so I didn't lose too much in absolute $$). My used '98 Range Rover--I ate about $10K between depreciation, & maintenence in one year. That hurt. (You can buy a reasonably decent used car for $10K!).My current 2000 bmw 5-series has dropped about $5K in value, according to Edmunds, since I checked the prices last, probably last Summer or Fall. I'd hoped the depreciation would have leveled off some by then. It's a wagon, & gets 18mpg city & 23mpg hwy--I'm hoping that will help when I do sell someday.Depreciation is one of the things that makes car owning such an expensive hobby. Add in sales tax, registration, excise tax, insurance, & maintenence & it can get pretty expensive to own more vehicles than you need (or even the vehicles you do need!).Also, I'm not sure Toyotas always have the great resale value of Hondas???.....It may not just be gas prices hitting the value of your vehicle, 4Runners do depreciate.....

Not sure why and I wouldn't buy one because of the lack of a sunroof. But I still like it. The Si is obviously a superior car to the Fit but the Fit just seems like perfect basic transportation. It reminds me of our 89 Civic wagon which we took on several memorable trips. Also, unlike the Yaris it has a normal guage cluster instead of center-mounted and it has a very functional interior.

"qbrozen","May 2006"," Well, someone took an 11-hour train ride to buy my Volvo last night.After doing some thinking, calculating, and discussing with the wife, I'm going to now try to sell my Lincoln after just 7 months of ownership.If I can't, no big deal. But we really shouldn't have such a tough time. I mean, its certified and I only owe about $1k over wholesale on it, so I should be able to come out clean.What's next? Well, the front runner is an Accord 6-speed sedan lease. What do y'all think? "
"michaellno","May 2006"," The Accord is a good choice, I would think.Why lease versus another purchase? "
"qbrozen","May 2006"," Because I switch cars so damned much.After my first lease, I always said I would never do it again .... but its appealing to me lately. I mean, if I'm going to keep trading out of my cars before I have any equity, why not just lease and take advantage of the low rates they offer?I used to drive too many miles, and I suppose that could always happen again and really screw me up, but I think I'm in a good financial position these days that I could work it out if something were to change. PLUS, I'm looking to lease well below my means rather than at or above my means, which I believe is what most people do and how they seem to get in trouble. What I mean is, I could afford a much larger payment than I would get with leasing an Accord, for instance. "

"woodyww","May 2006"," FWIW, I looked up the repair ratings on the LS in CR. They look pretty bad, which surprised me a bit. It seems like it might be an excellent idea to sell it before the warranty runs out. Also, I wonder about the resale value of Lincolns in later years w/no warranty.....(?)What does it cost to lease an Accord 6-speed sedan? "
"qbrozen","May 2006"," Honda is running a lease deal that includes a money factor of .00079 and residual of 58% for 3-years, plus they have $750 marketing support on them, too. So it all depends on what you get it for, but, based on my calculations, I should be able to pick one up with about $1200 down (which would just be the security deposit, first months, tags, etc) for about $280 without NAV or $320 with NAV (which changes the residual to 56%).I'm really inclined to get the NAV, but it makes locating one much tougher, and $40 a month is alot to pay for a toy.

"perna","May 2006"," He should sell it right now. In my experience, $10K per year is the minimum depreciation you can expect on a LR. I'm surprised he can do that well. Trading it on another LR however........the word masochistic springs to mind.To people like us with average incomes, you are 100% correct.However, it was like the conversation my wife and I had the other day about people who buy Hummers. She wondered aloud why anyone would want to waste that much gas, and I replied that people who can buy $50,000 boxes with limited practicality don't necessarily give a rip about large gas bills, or the environment. Buying something like a Land Rover is even more foreign to my thinking, though. Imagine what your house would be like if you did $90,000 worth of home improvements, for example. There's a law of diminishing returns with cars, and anything over $40-$50k blows right past it. "

Remarkably none of their Range Rovers have been problem cars either. Putting that kind of miles on a Rover a year is just asking for trouble but if you look at the work order history they have had minimal problems. "
"qbrozen","May 2006"," yup. EX V6 6-speed (although automatic would be the same price). EX comes with the leather, heated seats, 6-cd, moonroof, etc, etc. Yeah, $40/mo is real tough to swallow. I mean, I could get a portable NAV for less than 1-year of that extra $40/mo. BUT, I do really like the coolness factor of being able to ""tell"" the car what temperature you'd like the cabin set at and what radio station to tune into. I dunno. Maybe I could compromise with myself and scrape up another $500 down and then it would only be about $25/mo extra.What could I get for the Lincoln? Well, that's the all-encompassing question. KBB says $20,600. But that's pretty high. It is certified, which is a big plus. But my plan is to list it for $19,500 and take $18,500. Now I just gotta get my butt to the car wash (or maybe i'll wash it myself tonight) and take pics. The worst part is I could get right around $18,500 if I were trading it in for a new purchase. The trade-in value plus the tax break would get me right near my number. HOWEVER, to the best of my knowledge (which isn't really all that great; it consists of hearing it from a guy who heard it from a guy), the tax break doesn't exist when leasing the new car.  "

I only bought the pickup a couple years ago because I got a REALLY good deal from my father-in-law, but I don't really like pickups and I DO like driving compacts w/5 spd manuals. Therefore, I have begun to search for a '01 or '02 Chevy Prizm. With gas prices getting as high as they are, I can almost justify it. "

"stickguy","May 2006"," I didn't realize that I was so famous.Anyway, to satisfy my CCB Jones, I have started eyeballing cheap cars for when my son get his license. OK, he doesn't turn 15 until June, which means he won't even have a permit for 13 months, but you have to start these things early!And face it, there's no chance I teach him to drive stick on my car. I won't even let my wife drive it. So, a perfect excuse to buy a third car, that he can eventually have as his own. Even though in NJ he will have to be 17 before he can drive solo I think.So far, I saw a 1980's (maybe earlier 90's) Sentra (the boxy one)(although I didn't stop to look so i don't know price or tranny). And the other day, out front of the detail shop I visit occassionally (or maybe the tranny shop next door) there was a mid-generation Ranger. White with odd blue graphics, standard cab, with $795 written on the windshield.The price caught my eye. Could be a possible if it was a 5 speed. Tough, cheap to fix and hard to hurt, plus it has some practical value to me. even the insurance should be as low as it could go.I can't wait until next year when I can start shopping seriously. I also wouldn't mind having a little PU again for hauling duty (to save abuse on the odyssey), so I might kill 2 birds with one stone. "
"michaellno","May 2006"," A heads up on shopping for teens.Don't know what the rules are in NJ, but here in CO when there are 3 drivers and 3 vehicles the teen must be 'rated' on one of them. This means that the insurance premiums will be much higher.In addition, I was told by my agent that the cheapest 'type' of vehicle to insure for a teen is a 4-door sedan. Saturns, for some reason, are less expensive than other makes. 2-seat vehicles (like the Ranger you saw) are probably at the other end of the spectrum.Just some food for thought as you begin your search.EDIT: one other thought .. I read an article somewhere that had some good suggestions for teen drivers. The article suggested that the child needs to have an amount in the bank equivalent to the deductible on the insurance policy. That way, if they get into an accident, they can pay the deductible themselves. And, they have to replentish the deductible amount before they can start driving again. This policy worked well with our teenaged son, who was involved in 3 accidents in the first 2 years he had his license. "
"stickguy","May 2006"," I live in NJ. When you add a teen to the policy, they just drop a suction hose into your bank account and take everything in it. So, I honestly am not sure how they work the pricing, and I don't think I want to know yet!At least until he is 17, he can't drive alone, so they really can't treat him as a real driver. And if it is really too expensive, no 3rd car (which at this point he would be paying for himself).Either that, or I move to NH or VA just to save on insurance. "
"guss","May 2006"," I think make an excellent choice for a first time driver. Just make sure you get the regular cab so they can't haul too many friends around. I read a study somewhere that said the majority of teen deaths occur when there are 3 or more people in the car.I think I would also get the 2wd 4 banger to keep the horseplay down.It can also double as work truck if your son wants to start a lawn care business on the side.

"andre1969","May 2006"," my Mom and stepdad made me get a policy in my own name once I started driving. It was expensive at first, $1361 the first year for just liability, and that was way back in 1987! But if nothing else, since they made me get the car in my own name, and the insurance in my own name, it cut out all of those idle ""do what we tell you to do or we'll take the car away from you!!"" threats. :P "
"geo9","May 2006"," Yea, Here in NY a 16 yo can't be responsible in the eyesof the law so mom and dad are on the hook !We just put the kids cars and insurance in grandmas name (who no longer drives and has NO assets) so IF somethinghappens the [non-permissible content removed] lawyers can't get anything !Stick: Most of these kids can't operate a stick vehicle.These new fwds are too fragile IMO.

The other choice is a newer odyssey, which is really too big IMO to comfortably teach a kid to drive on. Let them learn on something more manageable (and cheaper!!), and work up to a barge.I also like the idea of a compact reg cab PU, since it will help teach driving dynamics (such as RWD traction on a wet road!) the way i learned it. It will also be tough as nails, cheap to run, slower than dirt, and unable to hold a car load of friends (unless they are in the bed, which would be grounds for immediate removal of license and all driving privleges).The driving schools near us (which you are required to use if they want a permit at 16) tend to have old K cars, Cavaliers, Neons, and other cars of that size range.

I'll be glad when we see more trucks come with traction and skid control systems. "
"michaellno","May 2006"," Having been through this twice - and with the kids being at the opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of their attitude towards driving and their ability - I feel pretty comfortable speaking on this topic.What we did:-> Provided a relatively new car for them to drive; nothing that would require a lot of repairs or leave them stranded. The idea is that if they were going to drive, then make sure that you (as parents) weren't schlepping them around when the car was broke.-> Make the kid pay for their own insurance and gas. Parents take care of the maintenance and repairs. And, as noted above, make sure the child has enough $$$ in savings to cover the deductible. Teaches them responsibility without weighing them down with too much $$$ obligation.-> Both of our kids went to driving school .. saves money on the insurance policy (which, remember, they are paying for). Luckily for us, some friends of ours started a driving school in our town so we got the ""friends and family"" discount - $200 instead of $400-> The child has to work a part time job. Both of our kids got jobs at the local grocery store as courtesy clerks, paying around $7/hr. They worked, on average, 25 hours or so a week, so there was enough money to cover gas and insurance, plus some spending money left over.Now, this is what worked for us. Your mileage may vary. One kid (19) is now on his own and paying for all of this car related expenses, while the other kid (17) is going off to college in the fall. She is still paying her own insurance ($153/mo) and gas, and has managed to save up enough money to buy her own laptop ($1500) and pretty much every DVD known to man (her collection is larger than ours!).As has been documented extensively in this forum, we still haven't fully decided if she is going to take the car to school or not.

"michaellno","May 2006"," This is why many states have, or are introducing, 'graduated' licenses when issued to new drivers. Colorado now has this, but unfortunately, it didn't apply to my 16 year old son when he got his license over 3 years ago.Five weeks after acquiring said license, he was driving home from school with himself, a friend and his sister in the car. He had dropped off another student and was taking the 'back way' home. The back way, in this case, being a dirt road.Well, being a 16 year old boy and believing himself to be indestructable, he was speeding along at a jaunty 60+ MPH when approaching a curve. He lost control and hit the 18"" high berm on the side of the road. He rolled the car twice and vaulted (butt-over-nose) once before it came to rest, 117' feet later.The most serious injury sustained was a moderate concussion suffered by my daughter - she was air-lifted to the nearest hospital and spent 4 days there recovering. No broken bones, and only a few bumps, bruises and burns (from the airbag). The car was written off - they had the cut the roof off to extract my daughter.The car in question was a used '98 Chevy Tracker 4-door. We had bought it because we didn't think it would be fast enough to get into any trouble with. It was also a one owner car (retired GM exec). In addition, we had warned him that, as an SUV, it was more prone to tipping in corners - he had, in fact, spent most of his pre-license time behind the wheel of a Ford Explorer, so we felt comfortable with him in another SUV.

Much as I'd love a '95 5 series... not for a teenager.My personal recommendation is still an '88 Caprice with the secondaries welded shut.-Mathias "
"andre1969","May 2006"," My personal recommendation is still an '88 Caprice with the secondaries welded shut. Ooh, I kinda like that idea! Or, along those lines, a late '88 or an '89 Mopar M-body (Gran Fury, Diplomat, 5th Ave) might be a good choice. They're unitized as opposed to body-on-frame, so they fold up in a more controlled fashion. And those particular years I mentioned had a standard driver's side airbag. And they only had 318-2bbls with 140 hp, so they weren't that exciting.Just don't get an ex-police car, though! As boxy as the are, they'll still hit 125 mph with little strain and can get you into all sorts of trouble. They're not THAT fast off the line, such as from 0-60, but they really open up at higher speeds.As for the Taurus, if it matters, I remember NHTSA mentioning that when they tested the 1996, it was the safest car they had ever tested up to that point in time.

"jlawrence01","May 2006"," My personal recommendation is still an '88 Caprice with the secondaries welded shut. I am not sure what secondaries are ...We had an engineering intern a couple of years ago who had one of those Caprices ... and a book full of speeding tickets to boot.Agree completely with the Taurus recommendation although most midsized sedans would qualify. My preference (for teenagers) are underpowered 4 cylinder engines. "
"jefferyg","May 2006"," If it will run at all you could sell it for twice that price here where I live in South Mississippi. I also predict that it will be cheaper to insure than many other vehicles. At $795 you don't need anything more than liability. A complete windshield replacement is less than $200 on a Ranger, so there's no need to even carry comprehensive coverage on it. My 96 Ranger XL extended cab with 242,000 miles on it costs me $23 per month to insure. A tankful of gas is twice that much. The tag is only about $30 a year, and with the 4-cyl and a 5-speed, I'm getting a hair better than 20 mpg around town. The way I figure it, even with occasional repairs it's CHEAP transportation. "
"corvette","May 2006"," Also, I think that pickups--especially regular cabs--are more prone to roof crush than SUVs in a rollover (assume you're in a situation where it's a given that any car will roll over). A regular cab pickup has 3-4,000 lbs. to support using only four pillars and a small roof area; a sedan, coupe, or SUV has at least six pillars and a larger roof area. An extended or crew cab pickup has more pillars for strength but still has a small square footage of roof area (relative to the size of the vehicle) over which to distribute the weight. The body panels on the Canyon appear to be thinner than the old Sonoma--they dent rather easily, and there is even a TSB that says you have to install a bracing kit if you want to install a toolbox in the bed. But I still think the Canyon has a safer/better-designed structure than the Sonoma.It's not that terrible to drive, as long as you understand it's not a sports car. A lot of the people driving pickups and SUVs lack this understanding. "
"andre1969","May 2006"," I am not sure what secondaries are ... Secondaries would be the second set of valves/barrells/whatever you want to call them on a 4-bbl carb. The 4.3 Caprice was always TBI, but the 5.0 may have still been a 4-bbl by then. I think police cars with the 5.7 were TBI, too. "

"british_rover","May 2006"," hehehe  I know I shouldn't laugh but I always find it funny when people don't know what carburetors are.And I know that makes me sound old but this next statement will date me the other way. This is a long story but it does pertain to teenage driving.My High school car was a 1990 Jeep Cherokee, full time 4wd System and the 4.0 inline six. I wrecked that car twice the first time I was still in High school and it was repaired but the damage was in the 8,500 dollar range. When I wrecked the car it was not actually mine yet but was still my dad's. The deal always was that when I had the money I would buy the car from him at fair market value.After it got wrecked I paid the deductible and then I tried to negotiate diminished value with my dad since the car was wrecked now and not worth as much. :P Yeah my Dad did not fall for that at all but I figured it was a valid negotiation tactic.I drove that jeep through the rest of High school and half of college before I wrecked it the second time.This wreck was much more severe. I hit my head so hard that I don't really remember why I ran off the road but I managed to piece together all of the other information from the accident aftermath.I ran off the road doing between 55-60 mph went into a ditch that was full of wet grass so no chance to stop. The police officers said that it looked like I locked up the brakes for a while then manually pumped the brakes several times probably slowing the car down to 40-45 mph. At that point I hit a mail box and then, while still in the bottom of the ditch, I hit the side of the driveway.The side of the driveway basically acted like a ramp and since I was trying to climb out of the ditch at the time I hit it at a slight angle.Hitting a ramp at that angle at that speed caused my jeep to rocket into the air and roll upside down. I slammed into a stand of trees at about 40 mph, upside down and eight feet into the air. The cops measured the mark where my bumper gouged a hole in the first tree that I hit and it was about eight feet above the base of the tree. I ripped that tree up out of the ground by the roots and was spun into two more bouncing off of them until I landed upside down in the wet ground. The skit marks show that I slid about fifteen feet on the roof after landing.I walked away from that crash with just bumps, bruises and a pretty big cut on my head where I hit the roof. I unbuckled myself fell out of the chair and crawled out the back cargo area where the force of the wreck had popped the rear window out of its frame. The front windshield broke but the safety glass kept it all out of the cabin. I had the front two windows rolled down so those did not break when the roof was crushed about two inches. The amazing thing was that none of the back windows were broken. The roof was only crushed a little bit in the front so none of th back windows broke. I actually still have the window from the lift gate of that car. I kept it as a reminder and there is not a scratch on it. My opinion get a mid 90's jeep cherokee with the full time 4wd option, ABS and air bags. ABS might have let me steer out of that ditch but I am not sure. Based on the marks I left in the dirt I did not try to steer out of the ditch till I saw what I was going to hit and figured out what would happen if I did it. I guess that when I first got into the ditch I tried to slow down so I could climb back out without flipping the jeep when I crested the top of the ditch. Once I saw the driveway approaching I stopped trying to slow down and just tried to steer out of the ditch but I did not make it. In retrospect I probably hit the best part of the ditch. If I had hit the very base of it I would have slammed into a concrete pipe that would not have had the give of the trees I uprooted. If I had steered a little bit more out of the ditch I would have probably gotten a little air on the drivers side. That would have probably caused me to roll the jeep across the highway and possibly across the very narrow center divider into oncoming traffic. "

It took a wild ride off the road about 2 1/2 years ago, then sat at a storage place until I got it last weekend.

"woodyww","May 2006"," I drove a rental Taurus in 1996 thru really bad snow late at night from Madison, WI to near Dubuque, IA, at Christmas time. Then, back to Madison a few days later in moderate snow. I was amazed at the snow handling, & I'm pretty sure it didn't have snow tires. Seemed very secure, & I'm not always a huge fan of American cars. I felt like I could drive it cross-country in Winter, no problem.FWIW, my ex bought a 2 y.o. 1995 Volvo 850, ran up way over 100K on it, & not a lot went wrong, until it needed a $1200 A/C repair at 130K or so.....another very secure-seeming car..... but I know taurus(es) (Tauri?) are way cheaper than Volvos..... *As for bang-for-the-buck, nothing beats a 2000+ Taurus in decent shape.* "
"woodyww","May 2006"," A couple of weeks ago I got really into fantasizing about buying a new Tacoma P/U. I'd probably dig one, for awhile, for what it is. But what you're saying would lead me to buy a 4Runner, or MDX instead (if I owned my own Sunoco station).*Also, I think that pickups--especially regular cabs--are more prone to roof crush than SUVs in a rollover* "
"corvette","May 2006"," It's just a wacky theory I have. I think you'd be safer in an extended or crew cab (more pillars and roof area) than a regular cab. And, if it has stability control, your chances of rolling it are greatly reduced (true for any vehicle). "
"steine13","May 2006"," Ok now I feel compelled to chime in here... I don't agree with the ""roof area"" argument at all.It is not ""pressure"" (force/area) that will crush the roof down in a rollover accident, it is force itself. And the force is given by the weight of the car. IF the pillars are the same size, I'd want them close together right around me in order to hold the roof up. Any force in any one place will be better transmitted to the four other pillars, not just the nearest one.I strongly suspect that roofs are built to hold the weight of the car + some safety margin, and that a reg cab is just as safe or unsafe as the rest of 'em.But it is simplistic to make arguments based on size or area or number of pillars. Probably more engineering goes into cars than into anything else on this planet.-Mathias "
"andre1969","May 2006"," is that an SUV is going to have a higher center of gravity than its pickup truck counterpart, so it's going to be easier to flip in the first place.Usually, the B-pillar on a vehicle is pretty strong, so when a vehicle rolls over, most of the crushing is at the A-pillar. The B-pillar often acts kind of like a pivot point on a see-saw, where everything behind it stays up in the air when the car is upside-down, as the engine is going to weight the front of the vehicle down.I'd imagine that if you take a picture of a vehicle and draw an imaginary line from the front of the hood to the B-pillar, that would give you a rough idea of how much the roof ahead of the B-pillar would crush down.And even if the rollover is rough enough to crush the B-pillar, the C-pillar almost never gives. So you could draw another imaginary line from the front of the hood to the C-pillar, to see how much the roof might crush down in a more severe accident.I do remember hearing a lot of flak, not too long ago, about how pickups and SUVs don't do too well in rollover accidents, and that they're not subjected to the same standards as passenger cars. They actually LOOK much safer than in the past, with their thick roof pillars, and thick doorframes, but I think alot of that extra thickness is just sheetmetal, and not much true support underneath. If you look at pickups from days gone by, cars too for that matter, the roof pillars tend to be much thinner, especially the A-pillars. The A-pillar in my '85 Silverado looks downright dainty! And the one in my '79 NYer and in my '76 Lemans look even thinner, although part of that is because the doors don't have frames around the windows, so you lose the bulk of a window frame.Or even if they are beefed up, I'd imagine that the weight of the truck has gone up so much more that it more than cancels the engineering advances. For instance, my buddy's tiny little Xterra, all 178"" of it, weights 4200 lb. That's about what my full-sized 212"" Silverado weighs! Now I'm sure my Silverado wouldn't be too safe in a rollover either, but just imagine how much more engineering a newer equivalent pickup, which probably had 500-1000 lb or even more on my Silverado, would need.I don't know if this is true or not, but I've also theorized that when a truck or SUV rolls over, it's a ""harder"" roll than a car, because it's a taller vehicle. Kind of the same principle of when you cut down a tree, as it falls the lower part of the tree isn't falling with that much speed or force, but the top part is going to hit that much harder. So it just seems to me that the truck/SUV would be likely to smack down harder than a car would when it rolls. "
"michaellno","May 2006"," Well, I'm not a structural engineer, but I can tell you what the Tracker looked like after the accident.I didn't mention in my story above that this took place about a mile or two from home, where I was waiting for the kids - our daughter had a dentist appointment that afternoon. Our son, who suffered only minor injuries, called his mother at work. She called me at home, so I rushed to the scene; I actually got there before some of the emergency vehicles.My daughter was still in the car in the front passenger seat -- her head was sticking out of the passenger window, as one of the revolutions seems to have impacted right where the A-pillar meets the roof and crushed it with enough force to flatten it. Fortunately, the window was open, and I can't help but think if the angle of impact was a few degrees different, there would have been a very different outcome.I shudder every time I think about that image of my daughter, semi-conscious and stunned, in that car, and how close she was to sustaining major injuries.

Been there done that.Here's my assessment of the various brands:I really love the styling of the new F-150, but I'm disappointed with its engines.The Titan is nice but gets pricey in a hurry.The Dodge's back seat is like sitting in a straight back chair.The Chevy/GMC twins are a bargain, but they are a bit plain on the interior.I'd have to wait until 2007 for the new Tundra.I love the new Frontier, but the full-sized Chevy gets better mileage and after rebates costs less than the smaller Frontier.I'm just not crazy about the looks of the new Tacoma.Dakota - too ugly.Colorado/Canyon - can't see it. My dad already has one and it's nice, but not even in the league with the other midsized trucks.Ranger is not completely out of the question, but I don't feel my kids would be safe in the jumpseats.Decisions, Decisions.

"guss","May 2006"," a real truck, but how about the new Ford Sport Trac. They're not for me , but you will stay in the ford family. The gas mileage though is not much better than the big 5.4l V-8.

"perna","May 2006"," I would be inclined to get the F-150.

"jefferyg","May 2006"," To either the Frontier or the F-150. I test drove an 06 GMC Sierra today - Yikes! The Frontier actually rides and handles much better than the Sierra. My wife said it looked like a ""work truck"" to her. Even with all the incentives it is definitely out of the running.The Frontier wins out on the ""fun"" factor. I think it's sharp looking and the SE Crew Cab that I'm considering comes with the sprayed in bed-liner and the utilitrack system.The F-150 is a better people hauler simply because of the larger size. It has by far the best ride of any pickup I've ever driven and with all the rebates it could be a really sweet deal. Both handle well and the two trucks I'm considering are almost identically equipped.One other factor is that I believe my wife would be more comfortable driving the smaller Frontier, so that tips the scale a bit more toward the Nissan. However, when all is said and done, it's probably going to come down to which dealer will give me the best trade-in allowance on the Mountaineer. I bought the Mountaineer from the Ford Dealer and am well acquainted with them.

I'd say if you're going to use it as a daily driver with only occasional hauling needs (not towing, since I don't think the Frontier can tow a whole lot), you might as well buy the Nissan and save gas. NOt to mention it's a more practical vehicle for getting around town and parking. Another option, if you're looking at small pickups, is see what kind of deals they have on the Ranger.

Dad's getting an inspection on the Beetle on Tuesday so we can put it on eBay. I'm almost certain it needs rear brakes, just from looking at the pads through the little holes in the steel wheels. Looked into doing it ourselves, but it requires a special parking brake wind-back tool plus a new set of bolts which may or may not be included with aftermarket pads.

"jefferyg","May 2006"," And I went with the Ford. It came down to exactly what I figured. The Ford Dealer was willing to give me $1350 more for the Mountaineer than the Nissan Dealer was. Rebates totaled $3895. $3500 Customer Cash, and $395 XLT package rebate. I could have also gotten an additional $500 for financing with Ford Credit, but the bank's rate was slightly lower and got the payment a few dollars lower than I could have gotten through Ford Credit with the rebate. After rebates, the out-the-door price on the truck was $25856.70, including tax, title, doc fee, and state inspection. Yes, it's quite a bit more than a comparably equipped Chevy/GMC, but the Ford seems IMO to be a much nicer truck than the Chevy. The ride is smoother, the brakes are better, and I could get the interior in something other than gray.As for those who wondered about shopping between the F150 and the Frontier. To start with, a comparably equipped Titan would have run me another five grand. The Frontier has more horsepower, but less torque than the F150 with the 4.6. Both have exactly the same towing capacity. The Nissan is only 6 inches narrower than the Ford, but it is considerably shorter. Fuel mileage figures for Nissan with V6 - 16/20. For Ford with V8 - 15/19, so gas mileage was not a factor. Bottom line is I narrowed it down to the two I like the best, and then took the one that I got the best deal on. Nissan low-balled me on the Mountaineer, so Ford got the nod. Case closed.I could have perhaps gotten a little better price on the F-150 by going to Jackson, MS or Baton Rouge, LA, but I don't think the ""big boys"" in the big town would have given me any more for my trade. Besides, I'd rather keep my tax dollars closer to home, and I'd rather give my friends the business than some stranger.All in all I'm satisfied with the deal I got, I could have haggled a little more, but sometimes it just ain't worth it.So, I don't know what this means for my CCBA membership. I'm going to be driving this one for a while. Beth will kill me for sure if I don't keep it at least five years. :P I suppose there's always that minivan she mentions from time to time, and who knows, after a year or so, she may be softened up enough to get another beater.

"jefferyg","May 2006"," While I was at the dealership today I also learned some interesting news for Ford Fans. The word that the guys at our local dealership have gotten is that Ford is going to offer a new engine in the F150 in 07 or 08. The new engine is a little bigger than the 5.4 and is being designed to go head to head with the Dodge's Hemi engine.Also, the new Lincoln Aviator, which was previously built on the Explorer platform, is going to be built on the new Edge platform.Another tidbit I got was that Ford does have plans to phase out the panther platform. So any of you fans of big, rear-wheel-drive cars with V8 engines might want to jump on one while they're still available.

"nippononly","May 2006"," Definitely, DEFINITELY, don't stay in a vehicle with as many problems as this one has, once the warranty is up. No matter how much you like it. Not to mention, the numbers are on the side of getting rid of it - why pay $19K to park a truck, rather than $10K now (and $20K more in the next 30 months) to have a brand new truck, something you like, which is under warranty and hopefully doesn't give you all these problems. Better yet, get something smaller and cheaper, still with four doors, on which you can come out closer to the ""$19K in 30 months"" scenario, but actually have a new vehicle to drive during those 30 months. Now I don't pretend to understand the write-offs you can get for your business by buying a second truck, or your specific vehicle needs for the business, but no matter how you slice it, staying in a vehicle the dealer CAN'T EVEN FIX seems lke the worst of all possible options right now. Oh yeah, footnote: with all the driving you do, don't lease next time! I feel for you - I do a ton of driving too, and it is what has always kept me out of leasing. It really is such a shame that those early Titans were such lemons. Now me, I am flirting with breaking my cardinal rule of car-buying - NEVER roll negative equity - to pick up one of these new Fits, or possibly a Yaris. It wouldn't be much, maybe $1000-1500, and I almost certainly won't do it - I have learned this lesson pretty well. But I sure have been spending a lot of time cruising car lots lately.

"jlawrence01","May 2006"," I'm trying to understand the ""Beater Philosophy"". (This is from someone who tries to squeeze the Buffalo off of almost every Nickel).Based on discussions with a lot of my friends who are ""into"" beaters:1) A lot of people dump their cars at 100k even though they have taken good care of the cars. If I can get the car for south of $2k, why not buy a car that will run well for another 50-100k miles.2) Lower cost per mile. If I buy a beater and the thing has a major repair (read failed transmission/engine), I can dump it and start all over again. The cost of dumping a car I paid little for is minimal compared to all the people on Edmunds who dump a new car after two years or so (and suffer from the depreciation).3) New cars have all kinds of gadgets that fail and that are costly to repair. Personally, I prefer cars with fewer electrical motors and simpler electronic systems.4) Why get rid of a car that runs great? 5) I run a car until the wheels are ready to fall off. Somehow, despite driving old ""unreliable GMs and Fords"", I am the one driving my company frivers to dealerships as they take their Saabs, Lexus, Volvos, etc. into the dealership for a warranty repair/ recalls etc.6) Most of my friends subscribe to the ""Use it up, wear it out, make it last, or do without"" philosophy.

On the interstate, in light/no traffic, detectors will do nothing. Cops don't keep the radar on all the time, they turn it on only when needed. If you're speeding and there are no other cars in front of you for the cop to clock, then the sound of your detector going off just means ""pull over, you just got a ticket."" There is no advance warning under these circumstances.Detectors are only useful when cops are ""running radar"" in moderate/heavy traffic, when the cop is using his radar to clock vehicles in front of you. Only then will your detector alert you BEFORE the cop clocks you. "

However, I did see an MSRP of $35K.The wife liked the looks of the interior, so that's a plus.Am thinking of going back one day this week to see if I fit comfortably, both with the top up and the top down.Am also thinking that since we're out and the Ford dealer is next door to the Chrysler dealer, that we'd check out the Mustang convertible as well.This is still a pipe dream, but hey, it can't hurt to look, can it?FWIW, I did a bit of research ... new '05 Crossfire coupes with less than 50 miles on them are being offered at a different dealer for $25-27K, so I'm thinking that something around $28-30K might be the right price for the roadster.EDIT: gee, based on your rules, when exactly are the conditions right to speed? I can't think of too many places (in GA) where there isn't a forested median or blind hills that you can't see beyond.Here in the west, there are plenty of places where the vistas stretch for miles, and 10 over is pretty much the rule on the rural interstates where the limit is already set at 75. "
"gee35coupe","May 2006"," On most interstates. There are places where there are trees and such, but now that they have started widening the highays to 3 or 4 lanes statewide, they are running out of room. "
"jefferyg","May 2006"," If you're only going to use it for going back and forth to work and the occasional weekend trip with just the wife, the Crossfire sounds fun. However, one of my friends who's a golfer, said a guy he works with bought one and when he goes to the course, he has to strap his clubs into the front seatbelt because the trunk is too small to accomodate them.Moreover, he's already ruined two tires on it and that's cost him almost $1000. The latest word from James is that the guy wrecked the car (hit a police car  :P ) and it took something like six weeks to get repair parts.I imagine it's just Murphy's law working itself out on this guy, but I just don't know if the benefits outweigh the risks, especially when there are other options such as the Mustang GT, which would be much easier to maintain, and get you a lot more car for the money. "
"mattgg1","May 2006"," gee35coupe -You left out one ""rule"" that I feel is important, and has saved me on several occasions...6. Stay in the right-hand lane whenever possible.A lot of people driving fast (80+MPH) will just stay in the left lane, since they pass lots of cars and aren't being passed themselves. However, this makes them vulnerable to being pulled over.Logically, cops are more likely to use their radar on cars driving in the left lane, since these vehicles are overtaking slower cars on the right, and therefore driving faster. If two cars are approaching (one in the left lane, on in the right lane) and the cop only has time to clock one, which car do you think he's going to choose?Even if there is only a short distance between slower cars, I will move to the right lane after passing. This minimizes the time I'm in the left lane, looking like I'm speeding.Secondly, this practice can ""shield"" me from a cop's radar, particularly if he is in the center median. Instead of being a sitting duck in the left lane, I stay on the right (shielded behind other vehicles/semis) until I need to pass. "
"qbrozen","May 2006"," Geez... let's see... I had my volvo for over 4.5 years and 85k miles, the longest I've ever owned and driven a primary vehicle. Then I bought the 190E as a 3rd car ... that stayed with us for about 6 months, then I sold it and bought the 350Z. Held onto it for a whole 8 months before trading out of that into the Lincoln LS. Now, after just 7.5 months in the Lincoln, I've traded it on a new '06 Accord 6-speed sedan.If it weren't for the fact that we'll be getting far better gas mileage than the Lincoln and the fact that the baby's seat fits better in the back of the Accord, my wife would be ready for a divorce. Of course, its for those 2 reasons I told her I wanted to trade.And I leased this time. I always swore I would never lease again, but I think it might work this time. Or at least I hope it might work this time. At the very least, I know I'm guaranteed something different 35 months from now. So this has been a whirlwind of vehicles for me, but I guess I'm making up for those 4 years with the same vehicle.  "
"michaellno","May 2006"," I, too, thought about the size of the trunk. I'm also a golfer and having enough room for my clubs is a big issue. It's also interesting to note the issues with the tires - while I like the look of the 18"" and 19"" tires, I figured that replacing them would cost some major $$$$.Wouldn't the Mustang also be cheaper to insure as it seats 4?For me, a V6 convertible would be just fine - 210HP would suffice. ABS/TC would be a must here in CO, but having looked through the dealer inventory, it seems as if that option is pretty hard to find.The ones I've seen around here sticker for $25-27K, but as I qualify for X-plan, I figure a transaction price of $23-25K might work. This is many thousands less than the Crossfire.The wife, however, also likes the VW New Beetle cabrio. "
"qbrozen","May 2006"," OH Yeah.Stickguy ... I did trade the Lincoln, and I DID get a tax break on the lease! I couldn't figure out how they were working out the payments so low when they were really giving me a low bid on my trade, but when I talked to the F&I guy about it, he told me I'm paying no tax because of my trade!I told him how I heard this didn't work on leases, and I believe he said something about it being a fairly new deal in NJ. "
"stickguy","May 2006"," all I needed, another inticement to trade my car in!I might be driving something different on a lease if they had offered this when I was shopping (back in December). Of course, the salesperson I talked to could have been wrong, but he was pretty confident (and I think the finance guy confirmed it for him).I remember the deal you mentioned. Wasn't it around $300/mo with little down? Nice car for that price.The biggest incnetive to a lease right now for me is my son. He learns to drive next year, so I wouldn't mind teaching him on a clutch that I am going to return anyway!There seem to be some strong lese programs now. Volvo is pushing the S60 2.5T. One dealer was at about $219/mo. with 1K down. "

"family","May 2006"," Well I'm not the best at Typing, but I will do my best to explain, we are a younger family in need we posted a few adds as a last resort. We posted ads trying to find a donated car. We have had situation out of are control and have lost allot and trying to survive with are 2 kids and one on the way.We called places that take donated cars and asked for help but they don't donate them back I guess, posted ads only to be ridiculed and put down. Finally a good thing happened we were gifted 1500 to buy a car. After having new cars trying to find something for that price has been very tuff, when you are trying to find something that will not break down, We looked at so many cars and found 1 in beacon hill from a persona named corky. The car is a 1989 Nissan sentra they clamed it was the best car and said they wanted to help us so much to get on are feet we talk for about a week she claimed they new people who worked for Seattle PI, and told us to make a list of what we needed to live and for our children.They drove the car out to us I did not understand why the car was so much more then any car the same make and year they said because it was the best. I made sure to tell them this is every penny we have and we need a car that will do the best it can for us. Corky acted so nice and sweet and helpful and all that good stuff. We did the deal I drove the car and checked it out the best I could. After I gave them the money they said they would call a friend at the Seattle PI and get started on getting us some help. They drove off and I got into the car to pull it forward to park it when I got out I looked back only to see the tyranny fluid on the ground I was shocked I wanted to scream cry as I feel I was so worked and lied to and now my family and I are in trouble now even worse due to we gave them every penny we had, then to be scammed. I called them right away they would not answer the phone then I left a message. I got an email back from them, YA know the people that came across as good people helpful willing to do anything for us. Remember its only been about 5 min since they left....The email said ""I must have done something to it and that & I bought a used car and that's it"".They totally lied to us and let us down and made us feel we had hope. All we have tried to do is get back on track only to be scammed out of all our money we found out the car is worth about $700 so now I know why they went out of their way. I cry now I don't know what to do I feel so let down. They acted like totally different people from the week of talking, to the email after they left. I just don't get why when you are so down trying to do you best and want to succeed why people would have to lie and cheat you, We are in the same boat and I'm very tired I keep trying if anyone can help us please let us know we are good ppl. They made it seem like we were going to get help and they had all the contacts of people to get us help. Its taken allot of pride to ask for help. I was truthful and we are in need only to be kicked when we are down.Chris&family[email?protected] "
"qbrozen","May 2006"," I did not spring for the Nav. I figured it would have added about $40/mo to the payment, and its just not worth it.I wound up with Silver because it was the ONLY one they had on the lot. I was really up in the air with color anyway because I wanted black on black, but only the coupe comes in that combo. The Carbon Bronze looks nice on paper, but I never saw one in person, so I can't be sure. The silver is incredibly bland, but I did get my black interior with it, and that's where I need to spend my time, so I'm fine with it.Yes, the EX comes loaded up. The only feature we will miss from the Lincoln is the cooled seats. Otherwise, the Accord is faster, more comfortable (shockingly), has a better stereo, and (of course) is far better on gas. I have been taking it easy on it so far. It is a lease, but who knows? maybe I'll actually buy it in the end, so I want to make sure its in good shape. After a few hundred miles, I'll let 'er rip. I have test driven others in the past, so I know what it can do. Quite an impressive sport sedan for the money (heck, it still holds its own against more expensive cars). "

"stickguy","May 2006"," No, not for me. My SIL wants a new car (SUV), and my BIL seems to be having trouble finding one in his area of boondocks NY, so he was thinking about having me find one down here, and he would wander down to pick it up.For some reason, they seem to have settled on the new Yukon Denali. Had a nice one sitting right out front the dealer, but I managed to get ignored. Wasn't pounced on while scoping it out, and was roundly ignored for 5 minutes while I stood next to the (empty) recetionist desk.Guess all the Pontiac/GMC salespeople are too busy at 10:30 on a Tuesday to say hello, so I walked out.Did see the Chevy equivilant down the road (a Tahoe LTZ). This one had an eye-popping MSRP of over $52,000. The sheer depreciation potential is mind boggling.But, as a vehicle, much nicer than the old one. Excellent front seats, nice steering wheel and upscale dashboard. Odd though that it just had buckets in the middle row, but no console?Also dissappointed on the skimpy cargo area. Next to nothing with the seats up, and not great with them folding, since they have to flip up, leaving a bunch of open seat track/attachment points on the floor.Didn't bother to drive it since I would never own one.Oh, and the mileage on the 5.3l was a snazzy 15/21, and the 6.1l GMC was a wonderful 14/19.Finally, they were a pain to get in and out of, and it was hard to avoid rubbing on the running boards.I don't know, but I just don't see the attraction, unless you need to tow a large trailer or boat, expecially at these prices (I know, wait for the rebates..)I'll have to convince him to get a Lexus GX470 instead. It even costs less! "
"michaellno","May 2006"," I will agree with you on the Denali .. my sister just unloaded her '03 ('04?) Denali and the rear seats just plain suck. Yeah, they fold up (and split, so one side could be folded while the other was still available), but not out of the way. I like the Expedition much better in that regard.My sister reported that she averaged about 12MPG in around town driving .. I don't know if they had the 6.0L or the 5.3L V8.I think they bought it for something between $45-50K and unloaded it in trade for a Pilot --- she doesn't know how much she got for it (personally, I don't think she wants to know) but she owed around $35K on the original note.Unless your SIL and BIL have lots of kids or tow a large trailer of some sort, I cannot for the life of me imagine why they would want a large SUV.Horses for courses, or something like that.Been checking out affordable convertibles in my spare time - I had totally forgotten about the Mini Cooper. However, when I start to price out an ""S"" model with some of the goodies that I would want, the price spirals into the upper 20's.By comparison, the Mustang seems to be more car for less money ... and it takes regular unleaded versus the premium the Mini requires! "
"stickguy","May 2006"," there is still the PT cruiser too if that floats your boat.As to the SUV, no kids yet, and no large trailers (plus they have a PU to tow the small one). She just likes the SUV style, plus they live in the country and get a fair amount of snow, so a 4WD isn't totally useless.They have an MDX now, so I imagine moving to a Tahoe is going to be quite a different feel. "
"michaellno","May 2006"," Yeah, I took a look at the PT ... wife likes it, I'm not so sure it's for me as a daily driver -- a little too 'cute' for my tastes.Like the Mini, once you get the one with some power (GT model, 220HP), you're pushing $30K. Granted, I qualify for the supplier discount with DC - in fact, I get the supplier discount for all the domestics - so for the PT, it would be invoice minus 1%, or somewhere around $27K.I guess I just like the 'aggressiveness' of the Mustang.Like it'll ever happen ....

"au1994","May 2006"," have you considered the Solara convertible? Look great to me, very Lexus like. Toyota reliability, but also get pricey with options, another Toyota trait.Agree with you on the PT, just a little to cutesy for me. Probably look good park out in front of the sorority house. :P "
"michaellno","May 2006"," Though one review of the Solara called it the least structurally sound of the convertibles.Base price of $27K for the SE. "
"jefferyg","May 2006"," As a VW driver, I am a bit partial to them. However, we were at the dealership yesterday for an oil change and I noticed something interesting. The fuel mileage figures for a New Beetle Convertible were lower than for our Passat 2.0T :confuse: I'd never thought it would be that way. The downside to the beetle is that if you're into the ""macho"" image, it ain't happenin! The Stang is stylish. The Beetle is ""cute"". But here's another idea.I say since you live in Colorado and play golf and you're planning on going to the Ford dealer anyway, take a look at a new F-150 SuperCrew. Sure the mileage is lousy, but you can carry three of your buddies to the scramble this Saturday and have plenty of room for all your clubs, plus a big cooler for whatever your preferred beverage might be, and if you own your own cart you can tow it to the golf course. AND right now with all the rebates, the starting price on the SuperCrew is comparable with the price of the Mustang.  "
"anonymousposts","May 2006"," 6-speed silver Accord? Nice. We have toyed with the idea of selling our Civic and leasing a new 6-speed. The way the deals on the Accord are now the proceeds from the Civic would almost pay the Accord note for the lease term. But Gee wants to wait and see what the 08 Accord will look like ...... We managed to get 15 boxes of laminate flooring in the Civic yesterday for a total of 450lbs or so + Gee's 200lbs. It was a low-rider but Gee was able to keep the AC on and still make it up the hills so we were pretty impressed. We still have 15 more boxes to pix up and then Project Basement will be complete. "

"anonymousposts","May 2006"," My sentiments exactly. Though with a Ridgeline we could've gotten all of the laminate and underlayment at once instead of stuffing the Accord's trunk with underlayment and the Civic with half the flooring.

For the past year or so, I had been hoping that the Saturn Sky would be the car. But, as I have mentioned previously, I don't fit so well in it, so I'm now looking at my alternatives.The one thing about this whole crazy notion is that I live in Colorado, and the top would stay up for something like 4 months during the year. Perhaps a coupe would be a better alternative ...When I travelled for business and was lucky enough to snag a rental convertible, I would have the top down as much as possible, despite the outside temp - just keep the windows up and turn on the heater!What really bugs me are those folks who have popped for the top down experience yet leave the top up, even when the weather is nice. The past couple of weeks has seen some pretty nice weather here, and when the wife and I are out running errands and see cars with the top up, we are a bit amazed.Would love to hear from those of you who own (or have owned) convertibles as your daily driver -- what was your experience? Why do you do it? How much do you really have the top down? "

Then I noticed a couple of other cars on the same lot that got me thinking it might be more fun to get something else cheapish, something that would be good for a highway car for my trips to L.A. There was a '99 Beetle there, 107K, in nice shape, the guy wanted $6500. Also an '00 S60 2.5T with less miles and new tires for $8500, and finally an '00 Impala LS with the 3800 and new tires also, with 75K miles, for $6000. Of those, only the Beetle was a stick, but I figure maybe that wouldn't matter much if it were my highway car...Buying used in the $6-8K range, the HonToys I could buy would be older than I would like, which is why I am looking in a different direction, but I do wonder: if I go VW/Volvo, will the repair bills soon make me regret it?

"mark156","May 2006"," Woody, you said: ""did you guys pick your Land Rovers totally w/o being influenced by the ""image"" they convey?"" Well, I picked the Land Rover because the Mercedes I traded was a really good vehicle but the new 2006 ML500 didn't offer seating for 7 anymore. So, I started looking around. I wanted a higher end vehicle that offered a large engine (I drive through the mountains and needed cargo space and power). I looked at the Volvo XC90, the new Jeep Commander and the Land Rover LR3. The LR3 won because of the space in the interior. You would not believe how much this vehicle will hold.I have two timeshares on the west coast the I spend time at during the summer. I load a lot of stuff that I use for the trip and the LR will fit perfectly. I didn't want a Suburban/Escalade because of the exterior size. I go to Los Angeles a lot and parking space is at a premium. The LR3 seems to fit me perfectly (four wheel drive, ability to travel snow/mountain roads, room for seven, space for cargo). I picked the Land Rover because if fit my needs, not because it fit an image (maybe a little  ). I also like the fact that it had front and rear bumper sensors which are not offered on a lot of SUV's. I would like to get better than the 12.5 mpg that I'm currently getting in the city but hopefully it will improve when the engine breaks-in. I have other cars to drive so I'm not using that vehicle everyday.A little Beetle convertible would be fun to scoot around town in for short trips. mark156 "

I stopped just out of curiosity and the owner just happened to be outside catching a smoke. She said she was the original owner and only drives it 300 mile a year now.It only had 55k on it! The black repaint looked pretty bad, but it had no rust.She was only asking $2200.I had too walk away without even a test drive.

A few years back though, while it was parked at the curb, someone grabbed my NYer's antenna and bent it back until it matched the rake of the A-pillar.

"michaellno","May 2006"," As a male who regularly drove a New Beetle for a few years, I can tell you that in no way did I feel that my masculinity was being threatened.The wife had wanted one ever since they were released in the spring of '98. Some good friends of ours bought one (red, with beige interior) and we had a chance to drive it. I agree with rover that the length of the dash was odd at first, but we soon got used to it.So, since we had a car coming off lease, we pulled the trigger on a bright blue GL with a black cloth interior. It was a 2.0L with a stick and the only thing we added was a 6CD changer.The family (wife, son and I) drove that car for 6 years and 70K miles before we traded it in. While it wasn't perfect mechanically, we were never stranded by it. Since we had purchased the extended warranty, it didn't cost an arm and a leg to repair the things that did go wrong (O2 sensor, AC, power steering, more belly pans than you can shake a stick at). The only real issue was its lack of ground clearance. Living in a semi-rural area as we do, we encounter a number of unpaved roads and a fair amount of snow in the winter; the NB (""Beauty"" was its call sign) didn't like either of those conditions very much.We used it mainly for in town errands and commuting - since it was a GL, it didn't have cruise so was not taken on too many road trips. It got around 28-30MPG most of the time.Would we buy another? Not a coupe, as the 'been there, done that' mentality exists, but the wife wouldn't mind a convertible. However, since she has her car ('04 Saturn VUE), whatever we buy would be mine to drive and I think that it's too 'cutesy' for me. That, and at the moment, the only engine that is available is the 2.5L 5-cylinder. Throw the 2.0L turbo and DSG into it and then it becomes a more difficult decision. "

"jefferyg","May 2006"," I think the color has a lot to do with the masculinity or femininity of the New Beetle. A friend of mine (older gentleman) has a silver beetle, and it suits him nicely. I could possibly see myself driving one in silver, red, black, or the bright blue. However, you take one and apply that baby blue color to it and YIKES!Another big issue I see with the Beetle is fuel mileage. I looked at a couple of them the other day and noticed that for the size car, the mileage figures are a little low. I believe your money is better spent on the Jetta with the 2.0T engine. You'll get both better mileage and a much more fun driving experience.As for the Mustang. I wouldn't settle for anything but a V8 in the Mustang. IMO, Ford should call only the GT a Mustang. As far as I'm concerned the V6 model is a gelding! :P I saw a lady driving a GT today in that purpley-blue color (I prefer red). The car has got a sweet exhaust note - just idling through the parking lot it sounded fast. I could definitely see myself driving one. But that's going to have to wait a long while. :mad: "
"guss","May 2006"," Kind of what I was thinking. I would drive a New Beetle because of the huge headroom, but only if it was black. Black seems to take away some of the feminist side of it.

Corvette's dad did great, as far as resale, by buying a new TDI, it sounds like. Do they still put the TDI in the New Beetle? If you bought a new TDI, drove a lot of miles, saved a ton of $$ on fuel.....it might be less damaging to the wallet than buying a used one w/no warranty.....?? "
"mark156","May 2006"," I agree with Jeffreyg... the color of the Beetle would make a big difference. But, I would ONLY consider a convertible if at all.The reason why I couldn't care less if the Beetle has a ""girly"" tone is that I belong to a southern California antique car club and I'm so used to seeing the guys driving up in anything from a vintage pink Cadillac to a vintage 1960s muscle Mustang. I have a 1964 antique that I drive to the car club gatherings (1st Wed. of every month). I would really like to find a prestine 1976 AMC Pacer..... or a 1979 Lincoln Town Car or maybe even a 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham. I like goofy cars, what can I say? Happy Motoring! mark156  "

That has to be the most ridiculed car in the 50 years of automotive history. I guess it would bring a smile to alot of people's faces as you drive by though.I know where you are coming from though on the offbeat cars. If the right deal came along on a later model Pontiac Aztec(the second most ridiculed car in the last 50 years) I would seriously consider it.

"andre1969","June 2006"," I kinda like the Pacer. I think the wagon version, which is longer, has a more well-proportioned look than the hatchback.And it would have to be one of the earlier models, with the simpler, lower grille, and not one of those later ones that had the pretentious, wanna-be stand-up grille. Oh, and hopefully a V-8.I guess with all those criteria, I'd probably never find my ""dream Pacer""! "

"michaellno","June 2006"," Funny, my dad always liked the looks of the Pacer. We ridiculed him for it.One episode of ""Pimp My Ride"" customized a Pacer for a young lady .. I think they put shag carpet up as the headliner material.On a completely unrelated note, I stopped at the Pontiac dealer to take a close look at the G6 hardtop convertible .. they had two in stock (one red, one black, both GT trim levels). They are pretty nice, but when the top is down there is absolutely no trunk space to be had.Also, and this is something that may seem pretty nit-picky to some, is that the G6 doesn't come with the AUX jack in the stereo. My wife has an iPod with about 900 songs loaded onto it, and it would be nice to be able to plug it and have hours of music. Granted, the G6 (like most GM vehicles) has an XM option but since we've already spent the money on the iPod - as well as invested the time to load our CD collection onto it - I'm thinking that the AUX jack is a 'must have' feature of whatever our next vehicle is.

"jlawrence01","June 2006"," I never thought that there was anything wrong with the AMC Pacer that a peppier engine would not fix.

Last year, a guy drew a crowd around his souped up Renault LeCar. "

I think the '54 was the last year of that style? Aficionados know the difference between the '52, '53, '54, etc.; I'd have to research it.--late '60's GM muscle car (I guess everyone wants one of those). A SS 396 Camaro, or Chevelle.

I think Ford did heavy facelifts to it that made it look like a different truck at one point, and they also gave it a wraparound windshield in its final year or two. "
"mark156","June 2006"," I have always leaned towards quirky cars. Like I said before, I think a pristine Pacer would be nice and I did find a 1960 Nash Metropolitan a fews years ago when I was in San Francisco on business that I should have bought, but didn't. It was in excellent condition, black and white exterior with a black and white vinyl interior.. for $9,900; it was perfect.My brother is renovating a 1953 chevy truck. I know the '52 and '53 have very little differences. My brother was looking for several years and couldn't find a good '52 and settled for a '53. The truck is almost done having a ground up restoration.Even when I was a kid, I had a fascination with luxury cars. When most teenagers wanted a '73 Mustang or Camaro, I would have loved to have an Eldorado or T-bird or Tornado (could never afford one of course but I lusted).

I think the Nash Metropolitan falls in that category too as does the Gremlin like you mentioned. I also like the luxo barges of the 1970s (Fleetwoods, Town Cars, Imperials).Older station wagons are becoming very collectible. A guy in my club has a Studebaker wagon that I don't ever remember seeing as a kid. I think it's a late fifty's model and he has the original matching luggage that came with the car and the pieces fit perfectly in the back. The rear glass and tailgate are very slanted; the fins stick out giving it a very interesting look. Another fella has a 1973 Pontiac wagon, wood panelling, vinyl roof and the clam-shell tailgate... very cool to see that work as the glass moves up in into the roof and the tailgate slips downward.My antique is a 1964 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud III, creamy white with parchment leather, left-hand drive.

"michaellno","June 2006"," Andre, you and I agree to disagree. I, for some odd reason, have always liked station wagons. Some that have stuck in my mind over the years:VW Squareback - as my folks owned one for a number of years when I was a kid, I have a fondness for them. Not enough to own one now, but on the rare occasions when I see one, I get a bit nostalgic. Our '67 took us from CA to NY and back in the summer of 1971. Turns out my wifes' folks owned one as well.80's Dodge Colt wagon - not the 'high roof' wanna-be SUV, but the regular 4-door wagon. Very angular, but for some reason it appealed to me.Saturn L-series wagon - yep, the wagon version of my car. If it was available with a sunroof I might have seriously considered it when I bought mine 3 years ago.Any MB or Audi uber-wagon (E55, RS4, etc.) - nothing like 300-400HP, handing of a regular car (not SUV) and a fair amount of utility to boot. If my lottery numbers ever hit, I would certainly look into getting one as a daily driver.Dodge Magnum - yeah, it's got a Hemi. 'Nuff said. Hauls more than butt.When I was a kid, a neighbor down the street had a Plymouth Satellite wagon - white with the faux wood applique and a blue vinyl interior. No clue what size engine, but it was large enough for their 3 kids plus my sister and I when we carpooled -- of course, this was in the days before mandatory seat belt usage and we'd all want to sit in the ""wayback"".

All of us guys thought it was a cool car.My dream car in that genre would have to be a caddy like the one Boss Hogg drove on the Dukes of Hazzard.And as for wagons, my aunt and uncle had a Buick wagon with the rear window and gate just like the Pontiac you described. I laughed out loud the first time I saw a commercial for the new GMC Envoy with basically the same feature.

Quirky cars are real attention getters in my club. One guy drove up in a 1965 City bus.... it was the ""buzz"" for the evening.Some guys in the club have over 20 antiques in their collection. I don't have quite the patience to have that many considering the maintenance schedules needed to keep them running. I have an excellent mechanic to keep the Rolls running at $100 an hour; a recent full tune-up cost me $1,200. He charges $75 and hour for domestics.I've always beat to a different drummer and probably always will. :surprise: Mark156 "
"andre1969","June 2006"," Woody, when you drive up in the same antique every month, it looses it's excitement.I hate to say it, but that's one reason why I haven't been attending this local cruise-in that goes on every Monday. I went to it once last year, and went about a month ago. It was mostly the same cars, and it's just not that big of an event. Plus, I didn't run into anybody I know there, and most of these people seemed to already know each other, have their little cliques, etc. I have a friend who lives about a mile away who has a '59 Dodge Coronet D-500 and a '66 Galaxie 7-Liter hardtop. Maybe I'll see if he'd be interested in going sometime. One of the guys who works at the local transmission shop told me about the cruise in, but I didn't see him up there. Once upon a time he had a '62 NYer station wagon, but I forget what he has now. I know he has one of those late 70's Aeroback Cutlass coupes that he's working on hot-rodding. "
"woodyww","June 2006"," It must be tough driving to the club meeting every month in that old Rolls......I wish I had that problem! Seriously tho, a vintage Mercedes SL sounds promising. There's someone here who I think knows a lot about them (Fintail??).....I drove a 560SL before I bought my bmw M6.

"woodyww","June 2006"," This is my every-6-month post where I talk about selling my 2000 bmw 528i wagon & buying something else. The 5-series is great, mine has super-low miles, but it's been having occasional electrical problems, & the warranty is up. I was getting really interested in the new RAV4. A Loaded one would be about $28,500 after discount. I saw a couple of new RAV4's today. They look good, nice lines, but just kind of ""dinky""--they still scream ""cute-ute"" to me. I was interested in the current-gen 4Runner for a long time, but kind of dismissed it with gas prices at $3 gal. I saw one today & talked to the owner briefly--he said he really likes it, & gets 19mpg around town with the 6 cyl. (That sounds extremely optimistic to me). But I've read on some of these boards that used 4Runner prices have tanked. I haven't shopped prices yet, but I figure the savings on a 2-3 y.o. 4Runner vs. a new Loaded RAV4 would pay for years of gas.Any thoughts, anyone? "
"perna","June 2006"," If you want a small SUV and the ""cute ute"" thing bothers you, you really gotta go with a small pickup, or MAYBE a Sport-Trac. No mfg has really gotten around it yet - you just don't see many dudes driving around in a Rav/Sportage/CRV/Escape type vehicle. "
"au1994","June 2006"," Woody--I have a 2004 4Runner SR5 V-6 4WD and I get 16 in town. Maybe his was not 4WD, but I tend to think that is a very optimistic figure. I barely get 20-21 on the highway. Prices have tanked. Trade in values at least. Mine has lost 2-3k in trade in value since February.I still like my 4Runner and its to the point where is not that I can't afford the gas, I don't WANT to afford the gas. I've been kinda sorta shopping the small ute market and seem to keep going back to the Subaru Forester. Its priced right and gets 22 in town if you stay away from the turbo version. As much fun as that would be.RAV4 is still too cutesy for me, even after the redesign, and as you have seen, they are proud of them.CR-V is not all bad, but the interior leaves me flat, but a redesign is coming.New Mazda CX-7 is great looking inside and out, but is available with only a turbo requiring premium fuel. Plus in the C&D review they only got 14 mpg. I'm sure they were beating on it pretty hard though. I'll probably just end up hanging on to the 4Runner, but looking sure is fun. "

"michaellno","June 2006"," Well, gosh.My wife's Saturn VUE (V6 w/ 250HP and AWD) consistently gets 21-24MPG in a mix of city and highway use. Since the EPA numbers are 19 city and 25 highway, I guess we can't complain too much about it.I was back at the garden store on Saturday and convinced the wife to take a closer look at the Crossfire that is at the Chrysler dealer across the street.While I was (barely) able to fit into it with the top up (the top of my balding head was touching the roof), we never found out what it was like with the top down. Had 3 salespersons helping out, but we were never able to get the top to go down.Got the customary ""you broke it, you bought it"" comments, but, in the end, the wife decided that it was just too small. So, we took a closer look at the PT Cruiser and Sebring convertibles.As I've stated before, I'm not a huge fan of the PT Cruiser 'vert, partly because it suffers from too much of a 'cute' image, partly because of the hoop between the front and rear seats.They did, however, have a Sebring Limited convertible on the lot. Is is a leftover '05 model year. White with a black top and grey leather/suede interior. I think it had the 2.7L V6 and a 4 speed automatic. No Monroney sticker to be found, but the dealer sticker showed a price of just over $32K.We decided to take it for a quick test drive, and the wife liked it more than I did. Very comfortable ride, enough power to get out of its own way. Not sure that I liked the white with black roof; a darker body color would be more my preference.Salesman said that there were 'substantial' discounts and rebates available, but didn't get into any serious discussions as we had more errands to run.After we left, I told my wife that I'd like to drive the Mustang convertible as well. Perhaps I can get her to do that later in the week. "
"fintail","June 2006"," I think vintage SLs are, with the exception of the 300SL, undervalued. W113 (230/250/280) are lovely cars and 20-25K will net you a fine example. You'll pay a little more for a 190SL, but they are cool too. The 560SLs can be pretty too, and they are actually still depreciating. A couple years ago I passed up a mint 88 model, diamond blue to match my 126, 70K pristine one owner miles, for 14 or 15K. "

Hot and warm running air, pass rear window has a bad habit of popping out of its track, other than that, clean.Haven't seen it yet; I strongly suspect they'll ask the moon... and I don't need, but ""need"" is overrated. Any words of wisdom? Advice? Idle chatter?TIA,-Mathias(Four days until the World Cup) "
"fintail","June 2006"," That's the last year that particular model was offered...not a remarkably fast car for a V8. In pristine condition - I mean a car you could take to a MB enthusiast show and not feel any shame, it'd be worth maybe 5K. Any flaws in paint/wood/leather drive it down. With the assumed AC issue (these cars have very complex HVAC setups - it might just need a recharge if it has been converted, otherwise it's a couple grand to fix), needed suspension issues, and no other issues, it'd be worth maybe $2500...3K if it is REALLY excellent otherwise. I anyway wouldn't want to pay more, and I would want to know that it has been maintained by verifying records. They are beautifully designed and made cars that are probably one of the best highway cars ever made, and they can take a lot of abuse before they finally die. But once they have been neglected, they are not cost effective to restore.Problem areas are as with any old car - rust, suspension and transmission wear, interior decomposition, and make sure the vacuum locks all work.

"akangl","June 2006"," Until we pick up the new truck. However, today I was having my usual second thoughts while driving the Titan. I have never owned a vehicle that I like as much as I like the Titan. I was out on the logging road, its super sandy and rough driving, and I realized just how much I know and trust how that truck drives. I can trust it in any situation and know it will catch itself if I screw up. I know that a diesel 1-ton is the right truck for us and our business, but that doesn't make me not want to keep my Titan. *Sigh* If only the Titan could turn into a 1-ton.My little brother came down and put the new headlight in the Sebring, then he decided it needs a pass side one too, so was going to order that for me. Airbags will be in any day, will get the brakes done soon the it will be good to go. I kind of miss driving it, but the brakes are a SCARY thing right now, it don't stop so good, lol. "
"woodyww","June 2006"," Yeah, my mileage would go down. I get about 18+ around town, & up to 23 highway in my 5 series. Maybe, based on what you're saying, I could get a great deal on a 2-3 y.o. 4 Runner. (Of course, if or when gas goes to $4, I may regret it, & the value will tank more).On the plus side would be: AWD in New England--I might get rid of the snow-tire-changing hassle twice a year, depending on how the stock tires do in the snow. And more cargo space--I seem to always be schlepping stuff. And, I put on low miles per year, so the fuel cost wouldn't be too terrible. Oh yeah, & getting a newer vehicle, maybe even with a warranty.....The Forester is supposed to be good, & I think Subaru has hefty incentives or rebates now (?). I think the RAV4 is much sleeker looking, but like you say, ""too cutesy"" maybe. "

"woodyww","June 2006"," My other pick would be a Tacoma P/U. But I don't think the current-gen has depreciated like the 4Runner (?). And I think an SUV is a lot more useful for most people. I would not want a cap on a P/U, but maybe one of those flat locking bed covers would work.Does anyone know if MDX prices have ""tanked"" like the 4Runner?

"nippononly","June 2006"," I would check out the VW dealer the other day, just to see if the rabbit was in yet (it isn't). They had exactly one new Golf, a leftover 2005 GLS with a sticker of $20K, and when I asked if they could discount it to make a sale, they said ""maybe a little"". To tell the truth, the whole place seemed kind of demoralized - they had only one salesman on a SATURDAY, and they had almost no new cars at all (and several of those were 2005s). I drove the Golf just for the heck of it, and came away thinking it was overpriced at $20K, and probably at $17K as well. It seemed like a good deal at $15K. With the new Rabbit coming, and the amount of depreciation that 2005 Golf has suffered just sitting on their lot, NOT TO MENTION the poor sales and rep VWs have been suffering in general lately, I was amazed they wouldn't come down more than $2K from sticker. It hasn't put me off though - I hear the Rabbits will be at dealers in a couple of weeks with a $17K starting price for 5-doors, and maybe by then I will actually be able to find a Fit to do a back-to-back test drive with as well! :-) "

Ford has polished the interior of the Ranger quite a bit, the new ones are two toned and nearly sharp.

"michaellno","June 2006"," The wife was in a good mood, so I was able to coax her onto a couple of car lots last night.First up was a Ford dealer to take a look at the Mustang. Wife didn't really like it that much - too low, too ""swoopy"", too much of a youngster's car (her words, not mine). Also, the sight lines were not that great, front or rear.So, off to the Pontiac dealer to look at the G6 coupe. Immediately, the wife liked the looks of it, inside and out. We looked at and drove a G6 GTP in blue with the taupe leather, sunroof, 3.9L and 4-speed auto. Nice acceleration, decent ride even with the 18"" wheels, plenty of room up front. Decent room in the rear seat, trunk was bigger than I thought, though the opening is somewhat narrow. One feature that amazed my wife was the remote start -- she thought it would be great to have in the summer to cool the car off before getting into it.The dealer also had a G6 hardtop convertible, so they wheeled it around front for us (was still going through PDI) ... wife was totally blown away by it. Top up, it looks much like the coupe; top down, it's open air motoring at its finest. Totally screws up the storage capacity, however; there's not enough room for even an overnight bag back there.One nice thing is that I just got a raise at work, so if we can pay off the Saturn for our daughter to take to college, I can trade in the Focus on something with a slightly higher payment and still reduce the net monthly cash flow. "
"au1994","June 2006"," Congrats on the raise. Good to hear your review of the G6. I love the looks from the outside, but was a little put off by the interior. I think the 'vert is really sharp.The Accord coupe is nice looking, I've always thought. Pricey by the time you get a V-6 and leather though. I can see where the Mustang could get a stigma of being a ""young"" car, but you know what they say: you're as young as you feel!Would this be your driver or hers? "
"michaellno","June 2006"," Whatever we trade the Focus for would become my daily driver. Wife has her VUE and the kid is taking ""my"" (now really ""her"") Saturn L300 to college in August, so I can get pretty much whatever I want, up to about a $30K limit, I suspect.However, I do respect my wife's opinion about cars and will take her advice under consideration. Something low to the ground and requires a lot of climbing into and out of is an issue for both of us .. we like the higher seating position of the G6 as opposed to the Mustang.I have looked at the Accord coupe - V6 with 5-speed auto (no nav) has an MSRP of just under $28K and invoices around $25-26K. G6 GTP optioned the way I would want retails for just under $27K and has an invoice around $24-25K, I suspect.There is a rebate on the G6 and I qualify for the GM Supplier price, so that works in my favor.Also, for some odd reason, the wife has a thing against Hondas. Don't fully understand it, but there it is.Since we have the VUE for passengers and cargo, I've been leaning towards a two door of some sort. I've thought about a VW GTI with the SMG transmission, but, again, there's that 'boy racer' look about it. Perhaps an Audi A3, but when you start adding options it gets expensive pretty quickly.Not much in the way of coupes available -- looking at Edmunds list of those priced between $15K and $25K, they show the following:Acura RSXChevy Cobalt and Monte CarloFord Focus (ZX3) and MustangHonda Accord, Civic and InsightHyundai TiburonMini CooperMitsu EclipsePontiac G5 (Cobalt) and G6Saturn IONScion tCToyota Camry SolaraVW GTI and New BeetleIf I look at the $25K to $35K price range:Audi TTBMW 3-seriesChrysler CrossfireInfiniti G35Mazda RX-8Nissan 350ZPontiac GTO "
"woodyww","June 2006"," When I bought my one & only VW, a 1990 Passat, the dealership was beyond demoralized--there was a very wierd vibe going on. Then they tried to jack up the price on the window of the car. Then they kept screwing up the title, so I had to go back to the Mass. DMV several times, a nightmare in itself. Then the car kept breaking, & the dis-service dept. (to borrow Corvette's phrase) was totally incompetent. Then some kids egged the car. Then my 90 y.o. grandmother ragged on me for buying a VW. And then.......*To tell the truth, the whole place seemed kind of demoralized* "
"au1994","June 2006"," Unfortunately, I think you run into a lot of the ""boy racer"" or ""girly"" stigma with many of those on the 15-25k list. Why? I guess a combo of demographics and economics.As for the 25-35k list, lots of lustful cars, but it gets really hard for me to drop 30k+ on a coupe. Just the way my mind works I guess.Agree with you on the A3. When I priced one the way I (we) wanted it, I was north of 30k and hearing that the dealers did not discount them much. For that kind of $$, there were better choices. Plus, it still looked too wagon like for my wife's taste. "
"michaellno","June 2006"," I hear ya. I mentioned to my wife at lunch today that I priced out a G35 Coupe ... if I stick with the standard package and only add a sunroof it's only a couple grand more than the G6 hardtop convertible.She told me I was picking a car for my ego.... :confuse: "

"british_rover","June 2006"," Get a MINI Cooper S but I am biased. "
"michaellno","June 2006"," I've thought about a Mini, but spending so much money for so little a car seems a bit odd to me. The fact that it requires premium fuel is also a bit of a put-off as well.Both the wife and I actually like the looks of the Mini, but one of the (many) criteria we have for our cars is to answer the mythical question ""could we see ourselves driving this to Las Vegas?"" - meaning, is it comfortable enough for a 800 mile trip across the West. Can't really see us doing that in a Mini.Of course, we're a bit older than you, so our priorities are probably a bit different.As to the G6/G35 comparison, I agree, but when you look strictly at the prices, it's not too far off the mark.The bigger picture is this .. for $30K, there are a lot of different types of vehicles that can be purchased. Trucks, SUV's of all sizes, sedans (stripper BMW's and Audi's and V8 powered Chevys) and coupes, crossovers and convertibles.My first new car that I bought was a 1988 Isuzu Trooper. At the time, my first wife and I wanted a 4 door SUV. The only other option available to us was the Jeep Cherokee.When we sold the Trooper and replaced it with a smaller and more fuel efficient car, I wanted something with 2 doors - this was 1991. Choices? I remember looking at the Civic Si, the Nissan Sentra SE and the Hyundai Scoupe.My point? Even though we have a much larger palette of cars to choose from, consumers still have their own rationale as to what is important (number of doors, manual vs. automatic, seating position, features) to ultimately limit us to just a few choices.Then again, perhaps I'm just a ramblin' old fool on this Friday afternoon.

"british_rover","June 2006"," For the four months that I lived in VA and my wife lived in CT I drove my MINI up to CT twice a month on the weekend.It is a little over 500 miles one way and I got it down so that I could do it in eight hours.I know it is not 800 miles but it is pretty close. I also took my wife, MIL and SIL to northern VT one time which is a four hour one way trip. That was a pretty interesting trip I must say.I posted this on one of the other threads but you might find it interesting.My expenses to drive that car for two years and just under 28,000 miles were aproximately.4,000 dollars depreciation.720 dollars sales tax500 dollars property tax for two years220 dollars for registration(I got new plates twice)0 dollars in maitnence since MINs have pre paid maintence500 dollars for tires2,400 dollars 100 dollars a month insurace over 24 monthsFuel I have to really guess on this since I stopped keeping my fuel log after the first year.Life time average fuel economy was about 29 mpgAlways put premium in it so we will say $2.50 a gallon28,000 miles divided by 29 equals 965.5 gallons times $2.50 equals $2413.75 for fuel.so add it up.$10,753.75About 38 cents a mile which seems a little higher then I thought it would be.

Since the Dodge is paid off we shouldn't have to finance more than $10k tops.Looked at a truck last night, 2000 F-350 XL CC 4x4 longbed with 83k on it, drove really nice, seemed fine.

Not the greatest back seat, though. "
"akangl","June 2006"," Using the Titan for logging isn't something we planned, just the way it worked out. The Sebring wouldn't even get past the highway turn on the logging road, let alone 19 miles back in through 2 foot deep sand and dirt.We know what we need.......a USED base model crew cab diesel long bed 1-ton 4x4, that will solve both fuel issues and people carrying issues.I do agree that using the Titan for logging is silly and don't plan on doing that much more than another 3 weeks or so. Its not hurting it, just making it very dirty and setting up an all day detail marathon for me. "

In addition to, we will trade the Focus and the Titan on the new Dodge and then trade our old Dodge on a used ($18k or so) truck to take out logging. We have to have 2 4x4s, otherwise I wouldn't buy the new truck most likely. We will still end up with less car payments and less going out every month, plus we can pay the used truck off by fall time. "
"mark156","June 2006"," Akangl, how long does ""logging"" go on? Is it just a summer time business?Sounds like to me that you definitely need a 4x4 for the roads that you are using. I just hope that the new truck and the cost of fire wood are worth the effort.mark156 "
"akangl","June 2006"," how long does ""logging"" go on? Is it just a summer time business? Its a year round thing, we usually have 3-4 weeks of downtime in the spring while waiting for the road to dry up. Other than that its a go go go thing, we haven't slowed down in weeks.We just got back home (again) had to go move equipment out of harms way, there is a wildfire closing in and forestry told us to move our stuff.Last year between logging and firewood we made just shy of $40k, none to shabby me thinks.

"anonymousposts","June 2006"," for logging and firewood makes the money I earn at work seem like free money. Between the violatile market, the work, and the wear and tear on the car I have to wonder if it's all it's cracked up to be. The new truck you are buying will be about $40,000, right? That's about $800 per month at 6.9% interest. That's $10,000 per year before insurance is deducted. If insurance is $200 per month you are down another $2400. That leaves $27,000. Both of you put time into the logging business so that's $13,500 per person. Doesn't sound worth it to me. "
"akangl","June 2006"," The new truck is only 1/2 for the business, its not the reason we are buying it. Yes it will be used to haul our trailers, but its also our family vehicle, its replacing the Titan which has performed similar double duty. If I could get away with an SUV I would, but my truck also hauls the TT around.The used crew cab we are buying is 100% for the business, that's all its used for. Thus the reason we are looking at trucks for $18k or less.......much like the Dodge was 3 years ago. The firewood/logging is more a side thing for fun and mad money, its certainly not our sole source of income. Hubby is a career firefighter. "
"anonymousposts","June 2006"," thinking back to the post where the logging wasn't doing so well so you were going to drop the insurance on the Titan. That doesn't seem like it's stable enough to base over $1000 per month in payments on the income. Why not buy 2 used trucks? It seems there is a more logical way to spend the money than on a $40,000 truck which will get used and abused hauling firewood. "
"akangl","June 2006"," The new truck will rarely go out there, the main time we will use it is during deliveries, which means towing the dump trailer. The used truck will take the brunt of the abuse.Even buying the new truck and a used truck will still lessen our monthly outgo dramatically. Logging/firewood has its moments, we have had bad times, but so far things are good this year. We have learned not to rely on this income though, so hubby's career income will pay for the trucks and everything else we need. "
"akangl","June 2006"," Smells like smoke now, yuck!! We have been driving back and forth through a forest fire that's raging a few miles from us. Last night we got a phone call from forestry saying we needed to move our equipment out of the logging area.

"anonymousposts","June 2006"," Well there's always been a method to our madness. Except for right now when we have 3 four door sedans. Were we to need a vehicle that we knew was going to end up abused and put in harms way, I seriously doubt we would spend $40,000. Especially if it was just for fun money. Heck, the Odyssey has been our most expensive vehicle and it was heavily subsidized and barely used. We put 12,000 miles on it in 1 1/2 years. When we traded it in you couldn't tell it from a new Odyssey. "
"grandtotal","June 2006"," That's it exactly, when you're not selling anything you have to make every sale count hence the ADM. Of course you don't have to pay it.

Of course it might be that they are changing the name so that they can justify charging much less for the same car. "

In fact, my further personal policy is to never pay sticker! :-)Now this car stickered at $18,8, and I would be perfectly happy paying about $18K for it - I like the design, the drive is good, the power is fantastic, and it had enough airbags to launch the Queen Mary (including rear side bags). Thing is, if I were going to settle for fuel economy this low, I might prefer to stick with the known (vs the unknown of VW) and get another Subaru Impreza. Power and price are very similar. The Subie is more rough around the edges, but I like the subwoofer in the SE stereo system, and the AWD instead of FWD. That's a great dirt road car. And of course, then there is the Mazda3 hatch in the GT trim. Which I could get for a little less than either of the others, and would have the same power and slightly better fuel economy. Heck, there are too many choices. :-/ "

I did price some used ones and anything that had less than 30k on it was priced at $38kish, concidering the price we are getting the new one for its not that big of a difference, new one is $41,500 OTD. Plus you can't put an exhaust brake on an 05 or older automatic, only 06 and up Cummins/Auto.In Alaska its hard to find a used rig that isn't A. a sloper or ex-rental, B. had body work, C. a smoker's rig (big no no with my asthma and little one's CF), or D. not trashed.

Normally, I never let the ""reserve"" light come on so at $3.65 a gallon and putting in just over 20 gallons was $75. I didn't restart the pump but probably could have put in another gallon or two.I've had the vehicle for over 6 months and probably won't put more than 8K in a year (it's not my everyday driver).

Another time I put in 65 gallons... funny to watch the gas pump go over $200.

He can deal with the 06 as long as we get the front underbody spoiler. The way we came to the TSX is that we love our Accord. We thought about other cars but they were always missing one of our hot buttons. We wanted XM like the Accord has, we wanted a nice interior like the Accord has, we wanted a nice manual transmission like the Accord has, and I wanted all of the safety content. We thought about trying to find another 04 Accord but we felt that was slightly idiotic, and pretty much impossible to find one with NAV. Thought about the Odyssey but the one we want is a little rich for my blood. Thought about a Freestyle but it's a Ford with a CVT transmission. Civics are still impossible to find so that's out. So what do you get if you want an Accord but can't justify buying your 4th version of this generation .... We sent a bid to our local Acura dealer for a Silver 06 6-speed with NAV.

What about a Honda Pilot? Its $15k cheaper than the Dodge and I imagine (looking at used prices) will hold its value. Don't get me wrong, I love having a truck, its handy and works pretty good most of the time. However, on long trips its a pain, grocery time its a pain, parking is a challange, and I miss having an SUV.I have the option not to take the Dodge, its not an odd truck, they said they would have no trouble selling it (they told me this when we ordered it).

"akangl","June 2006"," Won't see near the use(some call abuse) that the Titan has seen. I already told hubby my new vehicle isn't going on the logging road in the summer and only in the winter if I have to. The Titan has held up fairly well, no rattles or squeaks, does have an SES light on right now though.He is saying I can get whatever I want and he's cool with it. He said if I want the Pilot then by all means buy it. I might look at the Ridgeline, but it isn't much different than having a pickup truck which is what I'm not sure I want.I'm going to drive the Pilot I want tomorrow in Anchorage, its a silver EX-L with RES. Hubby hasn't driven one, only sat in one and leg room was tight (that's the only issue with the Pilot).We are taking the Sebring to Anchorage, so pulling into a car lot with that thing should send salespeople running, lol. It actually looks a lot better now that little brother put the trim back on the driver's side.The Pilot holding up is a big concern, I know the Ram will hold up for 200k+ miles, just not sure about the Honda.Then there's days like today when I NEED a truck, have to tow the big trailer (2600 lbs empty) to go pick up a dog kennel. Hubby is headed out logging and has his truck, so if I didn't have the Titan I couldn't get the kennel until he came home. These are days I'm glad I have a truck.......see the dilema?? "

"corvette","June 2006"," Thanks for the heads-up. Don't know if it's an ABS unit or some other part, but her old car didn't have ABS at all, so that's probably not a huge worry.There was an 8-10"" oil spot under it this morning when I last saw it. It's the 2.0-liter, which, in that model year, commonly consumed a quart every 1,000 miles anyway. Add that level of consumption to the open dipstick tube (now fixed) and the leaking oil pan, and there's no telling how fast it's going through the stuff. Power steering fluid is also a little low, but I have plenty of that to top it off with. Other than simple stuff like that, I'm trying to take a hands-off approach. Her mechanic ordered a new timing belt--I strongly suggested a water pump and tensioner at the same time. I'm thinking if the oil consumption gets fixed, I might suggest a diet of Mobil One to try to clean up the sludge. An oil change sticker in the windshield indicates a recent oil change, probably shortly before the car was traded in. "
"akangl","June 2006"," Maybe I won't go look at a Pilot, just called the dealership in Anchorage and they have NO Pilots at all.

"anonymousposts","June 2006"," but a bit smaller. It is sportier and handles better, more buttons, better warranty. The Ridgeline is actually not as truck-like as you probably think.

In other words I'd be driving all the time if we had to go any distance, maybe the MDX will be a little better in that respect. This is a common problem for him with Japanese vehicles, the center console gets in the way. The Titan doesn't seem to be that way. We did look at an Armada a while back (april), a new 06, went over a bump (normal bump in the road) and the driver's side flexed so badly that the door moved with a huge THUMP. That was enough to convince me that quality still wasn't there.I wish Mitsubishi had something out there I liked, I've been really impressed with the quality of the cars they build. My Sebring is the Mitsu variant and is very well built......survived a serious impact to a tree with really minimal damage mechanically. "

"stickguy","June 2006"," but funny comment.I thought you really needed to have 2 trucks available for work duty? Isn't that why the Titan was being worked so hard?I think you should sit down and write out a list of all the duties each of the 3 vehicles will have to serve (including the Sebring, which you should keep). Plan out for a full year so you cover both seasons (Winter, and mosquitos).Then, go back and read the list, and assign a type of vehicle to each task (e.g., pull small trailer = Titan, pull skidder = 1 ton, run out for groceries = Sebring).Tally the items for each car/truck, and ID which ones will happen at the same time (obviously both of you can't use the truck at the same time for a different purpose).This exercise should give you a clearer, more impartial idea of what needs to be available in the yard.The idea of getting a real HD PU like the Ram does seem to make sense, since it can serve multiple uses. You seem to like the Sebring for runs into town. The wildcard really seems to be what you need for a 3rd vehicle, but a truck of some kind seems to be the best bet.If you do want an SUV, how about a Tahoe? Not great mileage, but at least it can tow, and is probably tough enough to survive the environment.Or, get the new ram, and keep the old one for back up duty. "
"stickguy","June 2006"," to the old cars. The Odyssey is right now having an ipod adapter installed (no more FM modulater, can't wait!), and new front speakers to replace the OEM tissue paper ones.

He did confirm that honda puts in decent electronics, but probably puts in the cheapest speakers of any manufacturer.Only downside is making an investment like this will make me more committed to keeping it long term!

"michaellno","June 2006"," I gotta hand it to you ... your advice to Jolie is probably one of the 10 best things I think I've ever read here at Edmunds. Most of us CCB'ers just waft through life, buying and selling cars based on whatever whim or fancy strikes us.You, OTOH, have given Jolie a recipe for exactly how the vehicles they own ought to be bought/leased, and for what purpose.BTW, how much of an investment would new speakers really be for the Accord? One months' payment? Two? C'mon, if you're going to spend that much time in your car, you owe it to yourself to have the best environment you can provide.When I bought my L300, I popped for the ""Advanced Audio System"" since it came with a sub (a small one mounted under the rear parcel shelf. Makes a big difference in the quality of the music. Now that I have my L back (yay!), I'm looking to do a few 'upgrades' to it. First, I'm thinking about some new wheels. The 16"" chrome wheels are starting to look at bit worn due to the brake dust that has permeated them. I could probably spend $400-500 without too much static from the spouse. Been poking around on tirerack.com, but haven't committed to any one style yet. Upgrading the speakers may not be such a bad idea either.I also need to get a new driver's side floor mat, as a hole has been worn into the current one.Daughter says she loves her ION; at the rate she drives - pretty much at the other end of the spectrum from Jolie - she'll have maybe 40-50K on it in 5 years. The nice thing is that she's such an anti-car person that she'll probably keep it forever and get something new when it's worn out 10-15 years from now. "

"stickguy","June 2006"," Thanks Michael. I'm planning to put your compliment on my resume!Let's see. The speakers for the Accord will run about $300 installed. Should make a big difference. I don't make payments on it, but if I did I guess it wold be about 1 payments worth! Actually a nice way to think about having a paid off car, what you can do with each payment you aren't making!The new speakers in the Ody sound real nice, but I only took a quick listen with the doors open (to check the install on the ipod gizmo).I researched ipod connectors for a while, and the one I got is fairly new. It is from USA spec. Ipod interface part # 581PA11HN2 from Crutchfield. It cost $119.99.It plugs right into the aux port on the radio. There is a small box that I put in the tob cubby hole. The unit comes with a docking port cable that plugs into the unit. The radio seems to recognize the ipod, and you can change songs from the steering wheel, as well as the ipod.It does charge the ipod, and will automatically shut it off after one hour (when you turn off the car).Another nice feature is it has RCA input jacks too, so you can also hard wire in another unit, such as a sat receiver (anything that has RCA or headphone jacks).We are taking a trip soon, so I will report back how it all works.

"akangl","June 2006"," We did test drive the MDX, really liked it, however, after weighing the pros and cons we decided it was a bad idea.Stickguy......THANK YOU for the advice, we will be doing that tonight just to be sure that we are making the right decision.We learned something valuable about the Sebring today, its great for trips into town, running errands around here, but it SUCKS for long trips (drove 700 miles today). We fought over the driver's seat since the passenger seat has been dubbed ""The Pretzel Seat."" The kids were miserable as well. Granted it saved us a ton in gas $$$ so I guess the misery was worth it. Averaged 28.5 mpg, not too shabby from a V6. Its not anywhere near in danger of being sold, just kept close to home. It did great, no issues at all.We stopped by the Dodge dealer today and the new Dodge is there (surprised us), I got to touch it, sit in it, and WOW, its the most beautiful truck I've ever seen. We weren't ready to pick it up obviously since we were driving the Sebring.Right now we are thinking 2 1-ton trucks are going to fit the bill just fine. Silly to some, but it seems to be the only thing that really fits.So, its off to make some dinner, then sit down and make some lists. We really are trying to look long term instead of short term. The firewood business isn't going away (good grief there would be a lynch mob if we tried to quit) and our lifestyle will stay the same. We have one long term goal and that's to build a log house in 4 years, very attainable providing we do the truck thing right and don't fall back into the CCBA trap.We have time to think since the Dodge dealer isn't too worried about us picking the truck up right away.

"british_rover","June 2006"," The 1/2 ton, 3/4 ton and 1 ton monikers are supposed to be what the pay load capacity is. It is not always exactly right though.For example a 1/2 ton truck loaded up with all the options probably won't be officialy rated with 1000 lbs pay load capacity anymore. A 1/2 ton truck loaded up with 4wd, automatic, extended cab and then all of the ""luxury"" options people seem to expect now has a significantly lower payload capacity then a 2wd, standard tranny, regular cab truck. You can still put a 1000 lbs or more of stuff in it but you are probably techincaly above the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of the chassis. A lot of 1 ton trucks can hold more then one ton of stuff in the bed though. It just depends how it is equipped. "

Here's the problems:Trailers:Dump trailer, GVWR of 14k and its all of that with 3 cords of wood in it. Dodge struggles with it big time.Car hauler trailer, GVWR of 12k, its maxed out with 4 cords in it. Dodge pulls it fairly well as long as we are on level ground and not the logging road.Travel trailer, GVWR of 6200 lbs, dry tongue weight of 494 lbs. The Titan has pulled this in the past, but we are over the GVWR of the Titan with even the dry tongue weight. The Titan pulls it pretty good, slight tranny overheating on occation and it has burnt up one rearend towing it.So there you have it, the dilema. Neither of the trucks we have are very well suited to what we do. Guess it pays to plan for the future, hindsight being 20/20 we would have bought a 1-ton CC diesel when we bought the Dodge and the same when we bought the Titan. "
"woodyww","June 2006"," It sounds like you really need, & probably want, the Dodge Ram (350?)/Cummins. Have you driven it yet? I don't see how a Pilot/MDX fits into any of this. Altho, then, you're using a $40K new vehicle for logging, right? I assume most people who buy HD trucks like that use them for real work tho.I'm still betting on the new Dodge diesel. And hope nothing else breaks on the Titan before trading it in. "
"corvette","June 2006"," Sounds like a 1/2 ton truck with a higher payload/towing capacity might work for you, but your husband definitely needs a 1-ton for towing. Don't some of the domestic 1/2 ton trucks tow close to 10,000 lbs.? "

"jefferyg","June 2006"," Hey guys and ladies, I've been on vacation for the past couple of weeks and am just getting back in the saddle again. Sounds like some of you have been having some real fun over the past couple of weeks.Sandman - hope you enjoy your Civic. I miss our 03 sometimes even though it was a bit cramped with the kids in the back seat. I looked at my neighbor's 06 Civic LX a few weeks ago. I'm still not sure I like the split instrument panel, but overall the car looks like an improvement.Jolie - I hope I NEVER get into a dilemma such as you're in. However, I think in your line of work, bigger is better. Rob's suggestion may be a little over the top, but I was thinking along those same lines. A Kodiak or a Ford F450 or 550 could get you a lot more towing capacity, and many of those trucks are offered with a Crew-Cab option. You could even get a truck like that with a dump-bed.Speaking of trucks, I drove the new F150 on our vacation. Worst observed fuel mileage was 16.5 mpg and the best was 21.1. Much of our driving was in the mountains, so I'm not complaining. The truck got no worse than the Mountaineer we traded would have in the same driving conditions.We also drove the Passat, because I had to go to a convention following our vacation. The 06 VW Passat 2.0T got as good as 35 on the way up from home to Pigeon Forge, TN. It averaged 30.1 for the entire trip and we drove it a lot in the mountains. As for my next car, just cranking the truck costs $$$, so I think I'm going to be in the market for a golf cart - something to run about in the neighborhood and occasionally to use for golf. Anybody got an idea what would be a good price on a used one?  "
"ghulet","June 2006"," Wow, I've been there long ago, but can't remember exactly why (Dollywood?); I remember some motel there had one of Elvis' mom's cars (maybe the first he bought for her), a yellow or pink '56 Cadillac sedan, IIRC. Oh yeah, this was the trip my family (me, my twin bro and stepdad in the BACK seat, mom and my GREAT-grandma--she insisted on riding shotgun, good thing she lived in KY--in front, reverse 'Leave It To Beaver' style), made in an '84 Camry (half ton of people, Smoky Mountains hills and twisties, ~105hp, automatic and a/c cranked, do the math). That car was traded in late '85, so I was 15 or 16 at the time. Like I said, long time ago! Jolie, you realize we all at times think you're nuts, but it's all in good fun, and remember that too much truck sometimes is better than not enough truck to make a living. Just don't go overboard. And BTW, what happened to Zippy :confuse: Sandman, congrats on the Civic! I hope you won't have even the minor drama you had with the Sentra. My favorite color is also Atomic Blue, though I'm not sure I'd feel the same way (nor may anyone else) at trade-in time....anyone remember the aquas of late '80s/early '90s cars, or the purple mid-90s Civics?

In the winter it's a little tough though, the white salt shows awfully on black. "
"qbrozen","June 2006"," i hate silver, too. Mostly because there are so darned many on the road. Unfortunately, my new Accord is silver. The dealer only had two 6-speed sedans, and both were silver. But, on the fortunate side, its got the black interior like I wanted, so at least the part I am looking at most of the time is the right shade. For the record, I wanted black on black, but Honda only offers that in the coupe, for some reason. Yeah, I know what a pain black is (my alfa is black, and the dodge dakota i had years ago was black). But its the nicest looking when clean. Besides, I figured since it was a lease, I would get the best years out of the paint.  "
"jefferyg","June 2006"," I'll never get another black car... not worth it.. Amen to that. Our black Passat is one of the best looking cars we've ever owned, especially when it's just been washed. But one sprinkle of rain and the beauty is tainted. And if you think a black exterior is hard to keep clean, try out a black interior with two kids. :sick: As far as color schemes go, the favorite of my wife and I was the 93 Honda Accord we owned. It was Seattle Silver with a kind-of wine interior. Really nice looking interior and surprisingly easy to keep clean. That was one car that I wish I'd kept. We traded it in 03 because the A/C was going out on it. It had almost 150,000 miles and it could have used a paint job. I could have spent a few thousand on the car and gotten another 100,000 miles out of it easily.I imagine that I'd stick with silver if you could get another interior color besides grey or black. It seems that every automaker has gone in that direction, and while I like the silver exterior, I'm not fond of grey in either a light or dark shade on the interior.The one color I cannot stand on a vehicle is BROWN. When my wife and I got married she had an 87 Toyota Corolla four-door hatchback. It was brown with a brown interior. It was a gool little car, but it looked like a rolling turd/terd (however you spell it)! "
"michaellno","June 2006"," And if you think a black exterior is hard to keep clean, try out a black interior with two kids.Yep, been there, done that, got the t-shirt. Our '99 VW New Beetle had a black cloth interior that was impossible to keep clean. We ultimately gave up trying. The fabric looked like it would wear forever, however. What was really frustrating was the few times we took our yellow, short-haired dog in that car. You could not get the fur out, no matter what you tried.I agree with you on the brown ... when I was a kid, the folks bought a '73 Toyota Corona, which was brown/brown. Yep, ""turd"" is the right way to describe it.I (heh!) totalled that car in '81 or so. T-boned a lady who made an illegal u-turn from the curb. "
"corvette","June 2006"," I find black interiors easy to keep clean. They do show dust, but the mats will never get stained, and scuff marks are less noticeable.

He cut the price way back offered a huge trade on our trucks, lol, was doing anything he could to make a deal. I laughed and walked away. I guess the owner is breathing down his neck to not lose any more deals to anchorage. Funny thing is we tried them first before we went to anchorage and they wouldn't deal at all. Other thing I don't like about them is they throw $4k worth of accessories (most I don't want) on their trucks, why do dealers do that??The Titan has to go into the Nissan dealer next week for a check valve and the check engine light is on.

One of them is offering $5500 for her, that's ACV.

I'm going to pull that wheel back off today and see if there's another rock in there. They will drive it in the next couple days when I take it in to sell it to them. If there is something wrong with the suspension I'll fix it before I sell it.The tires are bad, at least the fronts are, they have a bald patch in the middle, seems to be normal for blizzaks (I left the winter tires on her since her summers are worn out too). The crack in the windshield is just par for the course up here, all 4 of our vehicles have broken windshields.I think in order to sell her private party I'd have to put new tires on, a new windshield, and figure out the squeak. I might be able to see another $1500 over what the used car dealer offered which after spending another $500-$600 on the car doesn't seem worth it.The Anchorage dealer offered $8000 for the Dodge (nada trade is $12,500) and $21,000 for the Titan (nada trade is $23,500). I feel those are fair, the Titans tires are less than 50% and it has a big time cracked windshield. The dodge has good tires, windshield cracked, dented tailgate, and some other scratches and such, nothing too big for being 7 years old.The truck we are buying seems like a fair deal so I'm not grumbling too much about the trade values.

"woodyww","June 2006"," What are you paying for the used Dodge truck? Is it enough less than the new one to justify maybe putting off the new one for a few months while you shop for another used one?

Well, I just got home and there is axle fluid all over the wheel well, tire, frame rail, exhaust, and up the back of the truck. I'm guessing its lost almost 1/2 its fluid, the rear end was hot when I got home.

He loves it - uses it on the farm for pulling a huge gooseneck trailer that they haul hay, the tractor and everything else on. He also said that when he took the pickup box off and put the steel flatbed on it his insurance went down. I suppose because it made it officially a ""farm truck"".

We got down there with both trucks (the dodge and the titan) and were met by the sales manager we had been dealing with, he was VERY upset. I asked him what happened, apparently there had been a screw up and our 03 had been sold. He didn't find out until he got there (his day off). Listening to everyone else talk, he was throwing a tizzy, cussing everyone out and such, lol. I was very upset as well. The GM told the sales manager to go grab a new truck, I was ready to walk out, I told them we couldn't afford a new truck that's why we were buying used, that we had a set amount we could afford and that was it. The GM assured us they would make it right somehow, they were very embarrassed.Long story short, they stepped hard into the trades and when it was all said and done we came home with a new 06 for hubby which cost us a grand total of $3500 more than the 03 was going to cost. Its not a stripper either, its a nice SLT cummins 6-spd quad cab dually 4x4 in his favorite color.......Flame Red. Ended up with a much better interest rate too on the small amount we had to finance since the truck was new vs used.We picked up my 06 too which is by far one of the nicest trucks I've ever driven, very enjoyable. I still miss my Titan, but I think I'll get over it, lol. My son gets a kick out of the exhaust brake on my truck, makes it sound like a big rig when I pull the switch.Not the day we planned on, I almost walked away from both deals and said heck with it.

However, I'm glad I stayed to see what they had to offer.I don't think we'll outgrow these 2 trucks anytime soon, both can do whatever is asked of them, they are actually meant for what we are doing.As for an economy car, I already have one........the Sebring, it isn't going anywhere, I use it for running around here, quick trips to Fairbanks, things like that. No reason to sell it, its paid for and costs next to nothing to insure.I don't see how we can spend any more on fuel than we were........$600-$800/mo for the Dodge (7 mpg) and whatever it was for the Titan (15 mpg).......$500ish I would guess.The Titan needed repairs yes, but wasn't ready for the boneyard, but the hip national bank was going to have to take over soon, the warranty was up in less than 4000 miles......OUCH!I'm staying far away from the car lots........going to start hitting the tack stores, might need a new saddle for the pony.

"nippononly","July 2006"," Now they will pretty up that Titan just enough to pawn it off on someone, who will then be in a nightmare of repairs (by the sound of things) in short order. Whoa. There's the perfect argument for never buying used!akangl, way to go on the two new trucks. Sounds like the sales staff MORE than made up for their screw-up at the dealership. Those HD trucks get used hard, I am sure, so buying a used one you would never really know what you might be getting into. This way you have two trucks for which you will know the entire history, not to mention having a warranty for a little while. Me, I am going to see what I can get for my 4Runner this weekend. I have had a change of heart on the whole gas-guzzling truck thing. If I can sell it I might get a new mini-Outback like I used to have. Better suits what I use it for these days - I think my days of mud-stomping are over.If I can't get enough for it, though, I have no problem keeping it for a while. Maybe try again next year. "

"lemmer","July 2006"," Anyone remember this one?With no great want or need, I bought a neighbor's RX300. It is a 2000 with 123K miles in perfect mechanical condition and all service is up to date. It needs a little body work where the bumper cover and just a little bit of the rear quarter scraped a pole. Inside, without a doubt, it is the most disgusting vehicle I have ever seen. Twin 5 year old boys have ground gum and other food products into the carpet, written on the backs of the front seats with a ballpoint pen, spilled drinks and done various other things that are beyond belief. It looks like wild animals have lived in it. Every door opened, every mat lifted, every crack examined revealed further untold horrors. But, everything works well inside, even all of the little compartment hinges covered in gelatinous former beverage products. I couldn't resist the challenge. I paid $8,000 for it. It is now as almost as clean as your average high-mileage 2000 model, but it will never be up to my standards. It still smells a little bit inside. I have added new floor mats ($120) and new eBay 18"" RX400H wheels and tires ($800). I have $8910 in it. It still required around a $1000 of bodywork to get it looking right.I have a friend who wants to trade with me, and I am willing. He has a 2000 Honda EX V6 sedan with 124K miles on it. Tan leather interior isn't perfect, but nicer than mine. Mechanically great with receipts since day one. The dark green exterior has a couple boo-boos a paintless dent guy could get and a good knock to the rocker panel/lower door. You could probably make the exterior great for less than a $1000. It got a brand new transmission at 40K, and been great since. Most importantly, it does not smell bad.This guy is a great friend, so nobody should get an upper hand on this deal. (Neither one of us would have hard feelings if the engine blew a week after the trade either). The only difference is the difference, as they say. So what is the cash difference between these two paragons of excitement? "

I am either going to completly remove the lowest level of the terrace or cut it in half from about 8 feet wide to four feet.Even I have a hard time backing down that driveway as it is very narrow, curves fairly hard to the right as you are backing down, has a steep downward slope and is over 100 feet long.My wife cannot backdown it at all she has to do a five point turn in the narrow upper portion of the driveay to get her jeep pointed the right way.

"scott155","July 2006"," My wife drove it about 10,000 miles before trading it in, it was mostly highway miles.It was reliable except for one big problem - at about 6,000 miles the air suspension quit working, we got a warning light, the vehicle was stuck in the fully lowered position. So we took it in to the Phoenix Land Rover dealer and it took them awhile to find the problem - it needed a new air compressor. Well of course the dealer did not have one and it was backordered from England, it took them over a month to get the part and fix the pump!In the meantime they did give us a dealer demo LR3 to drive for the month. We put 2,000 miles on it while we had it!BUT - as I brought the demo LR3 back to the dealer to pick up my LR3, the same warning light on the dash came on indicating that it too had a problem with the air suspension!! The demo had about 5,000 miles on it.So due to relibility concerns and (mostly) gas mileage (it got about 13 city, could do about 17 all highway) we traded it in and got a 2005 Mercedes E320 CDI.Scott155 "

"british_rover","July 2006"," I back down it normaly cause I am driving the rovers with the asymetrical rear window that lets me see the road even with the severe down slope. I will say it is harder in the jeep even with the window rolled down and your head sticking out but my wife is just not comfortable with backing up over that kind of distance. That is the main reason for taking that lower terrace level down so she can easily turn around at the top of the driveway. As to the Land Rover well you couldn't pick about a worse year to own then a 1996. I think that was rovers worst year as far as quality goes ever. All early build LR3s had their air compressor replaced with a larger more high capacity unit. Of all the LR3s I have sold only one had the suspension fault like he described. The others had the air compressor replaced as part of an upgrade campaign. "

They sold it in 1 week, which I think is a record for a V10 these days, lol. The Titan I cleaned the interior and conditioned the leather, but didn't wash the outside, didn't have time since it had the problem with the rear end right before I traded it.When we were looking at used 1-tons last month we looked at a bunch of them that were either smokers (no way) or dogged out (stinky!).

Even if it is only from a psycological stand point when you know that the car will be cleaned up and look fine. YOu just don't want to pay someone good money for a car they have abused.Also it makes you think if they treated the car this way from a cosmetic standpoint how did they treat the car as far as service is concerned. One of our old F&I managers was really allergic to dogs so he would just not get in a car that had a lot of dog hair in it. I don't even think he realized that he subconcsiously deducted a few hundred dollars from what a car was worth when it was covered in dog hair. "

"nippononly","July 2006"," that's so true. The interior of a car is much more indicative of its overall care than the exterior, IMO, because it is easy enough to spend the extra $4 from time to time and run the car through the wash at the gas station, but cleaning the interior is either expensive (if you pay a car wash to do it) or labor intensive and time-consuming (if you do it yourself). In the last year I have bought two used vehicles from new-car dealerships, which I had never done before (and probably won't do again - long story). I was amazed at how different were the standards that the cars had been brought up to, both in cleanliness and mechanical readiness. Funny thing is, the one that was manufacturer-certified was the one in significantly worse condition. The other was virtually immaculate, and fully up to date on maintenance. You are never reminded so clearly of what pigs some people can be as when you are looking at used cars... "
"akangl","July 2006"," Unfortunatly with our business truck its just going to be dirty, there isn't much we can do about it. We ordered Husky floor liners and they should be here any day, in the meantime we have been using towels on the floor. We still need to order seat covers, for now we are using sheets. Even with these measures the truck is already looking used, the interior is dirty and we've had to take it to a place with a high pressure sprayer to get the mud off of the exterior once so far. That's in just owning the truck 11 days. Running it offroad (well, 19 miles of maintained dirt road) seems to take the new feeling away pretty quickly.Now my new Ram is still clean and shiny, probably because I've owned it 11 days and had it in my possession 4 of those days, the Dodge dealer has had it the rest of the time. I *might* see it by Thursday, but I'm not counting on it. Good thing I love my Sebring! "
"fintail","July 2006"," I am sure some car dealers see some gross stuff. I remember the interiors of my sister's cars in her younger days - like a month old fast food dumpster, I am very obsessive about my cars, so they will never go that way.I bought a 7 year old Mercedes from a dealer last year, but luckily the car was owned by an older man and was fairly clean, just kind of dusty like a car gets from sitting around, rather than hard use. I fed the leather and detailed the wood and switchgear, and it looks like a new car.Before that I bought a 13 year old Mercedes, which was pretty miled up (150K). However, the interior looked like a car with 20K on it - the leather had no cracks, the wood was excellent, the plastic as new - so I could tell this car had been cherished. The interior is what got me to buy the car, and it was a pleasant car to own. And I maintained it just the same...and unlike some of these old beasts, the car was sold to a happy buyer in record time when it became one car too many.I somehow doubt people would clean up even if they knew it would make their cars easier to sell when that time came. Laziness is like a disease out there. There's no excuse unless you are using your car for commercial/industrial purposes. "

Right after I got it coolant started disappearing, took us 4 days to figure out where it was going. It lost at least 6 gallons in the 650 miles I drove it, we put in 4, but it was still very low. The truck had a cracked cooling line, took it to the Dodge dealer a week ago figuring it would be a quick fix.......yeah right, they are still waiting on parts. Better to leave it sitting there than to damage it by overheating, thankfully it never did overheat and appears to be no worse for the wear.

Today it was hot enough that it actually boiled over, and I decided that was it. I gave the kidney foundation a call, and they'll come get it tomorrow. It owes me nothing - I put almost 20k miles into it in the 2 years I owned it, and only had to do basic maintenance. I'm moving cross country in a few weeks, and I was wondering what to do with it.

"akangl","July 2006"," Will be interesting to see how much you save on fuel each month with the 2 diesels (once you get yours back from the dealer).....do they have big fuel tanks also? Mine seemed to average 19.5 mpg on the trip computer coming home from Anchorage and what little I drove it after, but I obviously won't have a solid number on it until I get to drive it some more. I've only filled it up one time and that was after the dealer filled it up. Its still not fixed, probably another week.As for hubby's, well, we have a pretty good idea when comparing to how much gas he went through with the V10. He would fill the V10 up and it would be back on E within 250 miles, that's not quite 2 trips out to the logging area. He would usually make one trip and fill back up with gas cans that he filled in town (we live 80 miles from town and the nearest gas station (30 miles away) is charging $3.44/gal vs $2.87/gal in town). So far with the diesel he is able to go roughly 500 on a tank of fuel. The V10 and the new Cummins both have 35 gallon tanks. He was spending about $800/mo on gas for the V10 and so far it looks like the Cummins is getting double the mileage (15 mpg vs 7-8 mpg). Not to mention it doesn't struggle and overheat pulling the trailers.He's got almost 2000 miles on his truck already and the lowest we've seen the mileage was 12.5 mpg towing the TT. His is geared differently than mine due to the 6-spd manual transmission, it has the same rear diff (3.73) but runs higher rpms, not to mention its a dually.I hate driving his, the 6-spd is too hard to get used to and finding reverse is a horrible challange.

"corvette","July 2006"," I'll try to condense this as much as possible. Drop my 3-series off on Monday, July 10 for an annual oil service, some electrical concerns, a software update, and some rattles. Return home in the loaner. Discuss pick-up with my service advisor, as I am in a time zone an hour behind theirs, plus a little over an hour away, so I need plenty of advance notice to make it there before the service department closes at 5:30 (his time). He says no problem, if you can make it by 8:00, you can pick it up with the sales department. I agree. I get a call that my car is ready on Monday morning (July 17). I'm talking to a different service advisor because mine is off on Monday. I explain that I will return the loaner after service is closed that afternoon. He asks for no clarification on that point, so I assume that the arrangement I had previously discussed was noted in my file. I arrive at the dealership's sales department at 7:15 PM Monday night. No one approaches me and asks if they can be of assistance. I ask the receptionist who I need to speak to in order to pick up a car that service had left with the sales department. She looks for the keys in a folder designated for such purpose, and they're nowhere to be found. Various sales staff promise to locate the keys. 30-40 minutes later, they locate the second service advisor--the one from earlier in the day--on the phone. I ask him where my keys are. He informs me they're in the car, and asks if I have my spare key with me. I tell him that I do not have a spare key with me, and that this was not the arrangement for pick-up that was previously discussed. He offers to have someone come down this morning, pick up the key, then return later in the day with my car and retrieve the loaner. I agree, and leave the receptionist instructions to my office (70 miles away). Given the distance, I do not know why they didn't just cut a door key using the VIN and use that to unlock the car and get the key they locked inside, but I digress...Their valet had my car returned before lunch. I drove it this afternoon, and before I drove 100 yards, the A/C blower started cutting out again (one of the problems that the service invoice notes as being fixed). The other electrical problem with the radio is still present, and all of my station presets are gone. :lemon: The silver lining? I did get my oil changed. :sick: "

"corvette","July 2006"," Why did they want a week to fix it anyway? From the invoice, they performed two recalls involving a software update, an oil change, looked at (but did not repair) a one-time check engine light and inoperative residual heat function on the climate control. They applied felt tape to (hopefully) quell two rattles, replaced a spring and some bushings to fix two others. They had to order various parts and let me keep the loaner until the parts arrived. The A/C blower cuts out during acceleration. Seems to be worse the hotter it is outside. The radio is supposed to operate (with no key in the ignition) if the power button is pressed--mine comes on for a second or two and shuts down. Both problems were very easy to reproduce, and I did reproduce them for the mechanic when I dropped off the car. Maybe I'm picky, but I expect all electric functions to work properly, at least when the car is under warranty. It is almost new--it's a 2006 with 14,500 miles on it--I picked it up on July 10, 2005.

"woodyww","July 2006"," I don't remember if this is your first bmw?

The place I bought my current bmw from were great both with sales (rare with bmw dealers in my experience), & the 2-3 times I took it in for service. They will also pick-up your car & deliver, if you bought the car there, for free or $25 depending on your area--a godsend imo.A lot of bmw dealers take the post-service report the owner gives to bmw veryseriously (bmwna calls the owners after the service visit). Maybe a letter written to the GM/owner might get some results(?) "
"corvette","July 2006"," It's my first BMW--sort of. Long story short, I attempted to purchase a 3-series in the summer of 2004 from the only dealer in Lexington, Kentucky, Don Jacobs. After they ""forgot"" to add the sales tax to the transaction and their courier coerced a family member into signing my name on the revised paperwork, I returned the car to them. That--plus other unsatisfactory experiences of family and friends who did business with them--is why I will not take the car there for service. I have a local shop who specializes in BMWs to perform the seasonal tire swap. My recent service visit was at Sam Swope BMW in Louisville--again, the only game in town. I had received positive feedback on their service department from a couple of sources. Unfortunately, that was no guarantee of a good experience. I am familiar with the feedback/survey system that BMW uses. My understanding is that the dealers are allocated very large sums of bonus money that is contingent on their having a good (read: perfect) score on their surveys, however, about 3% of the surveys can be discarded, and the surveys are not anonymous, so if you give a bad survey, your name will have a black mark beside it if you ever try to go back to the same dealer again--and if they do end up servicing your car, you may not get a survey because they threw out your response ahead of time. I am receiving unidentified calls on my cell phone--one at 9:30 last night and one at 12:30 this afternoon. I didn't answer either of them, as I usually don't answer calls that have the caller ID blocked, or from numbers I don't recognize. I assume the calls are from the survey people. I sent an e-mail to my service advisor this afternoon attempting to get the remaining problems with my car fixed, but haven't received a reply yet. "
"british_rover","July 2006"," I am going to guess BMW's CSI system is very similar to the Rover one.Generally within a couple of days of the service they will give an initial call. They will ask you a few questions although it might not be the full blown survey. Later on you may get a full blown survey in the mail that could be a couple of pages long. Best way to handle this since those surveys are not anonomoys is to call the service manager or possibly the GM for the entire dealership. Explain what happend and that you understand how important the survey is to them. They will bend over backward for you to keep you from giving them a bad survey.Your other option if the GM does not do enough for you is to give them an ok survey instead of perfect, excellent or whatever their top mark is give them one level lower. In the comments section explain why you could not give them perfect scores.I know for our surveys if someone gives a bad initial call survey the service manager will ususally call them before the written survey arrives. Try and talk to them and understand what happend so that when the written survey arrives they might give them better scores. "
"corvette","July 2006"," I think BMW only does the survey via phone. I also suspect the sales surveys count more than the service ones. I see the other side--I am sure they think they've already bent over backward for me, as their valet drove a total of 280+ miles Tuesday to pick up the key (first trip) and return my car?(second trip). But, my car's electrics are still acting up... I am aware of the survey's alleged importance, so I don't intend to give them a poor survey without affording them the opportunity to correct what went wrong. Thanks for the tips! "
"british_rover","July 2006"," For us service and sales surveys are averaged together and so if service brings down the average enough that sales does not qualify for the bonus money...The heat that will come down from the sales side on the service department will be intense. "
"rworrell","July 2006"," FYI, I registered at BMW's Owner's Circle and there's an option to do the service surveys online. After service, they email you a link. If you don't complete it within X time (3-5 days, I'm guessing), that's when they start calling you. My wife is quite the procrastinator, so they usually end up calling, but her last visit I got her to complete it online and that was the last we heard from them. Same questions, but it's a lot faster to blaze through the survey online, especially if you're planning on giving all fives anyway (we always do (so far!)--our dealer has been great). "

A phone call a few days after the service, then a paper survey comes a week or two later. Not sure that the service surveys have an impact on the sales bonus, however.While my service department does a great job of taking care of us, I do try to be honest with my grading and comments, as they are meant to provide feedback for improving the quality of service.If a service department got all 5's, all the time, how are they supposed to get better at what they do?We have a similar survey that we use for our work (software technical support). Grading goes like this (the question is ""how was your overall support experience"" or something like that):5 - 100%4 - 75%3 - 50%2 - 25%1 - 0%We then calculate the average.

"jefferyg","July 2006"," What is the longest anyone has seen their trade in sit ? When I traded in the '01 F150 for the Mountaineer (dumbest car trading mistake I ever made), the truck sat at the dealer for at least two months. It seemed like longer than that, but they eventually sold it. Many if not most trade-ins never get a chance to sit on the lot where they were traded - at least if it's a new dealer. Most are wholesaled or auctioned off. That's a big reason why no one wants to give you what Edmunds, KBB, or any other company tells you your trade-in is worth. The dealer doesn't want to lose money so they'll usually offer you only what the wholesaler offers.It seems that the cars and trucks most likely to be cleaned up and put out on the lot are when a Honda is traded for a Honda, Toyota for Toyota, Ford for Ford, etc, and then only if they are super clean. Not to beat a dead horse, but I personally think it makes a significant difference if you clean up your car before you trade it.Dealers like to be able to honestly say that a car was owned by a retired couple who only drove it to doctor's appts and church, kept it in a garage, always brought it in to the dealership for service, had no grandchildren, pets, or problems with incontinence, and they were lactose intolerant, so they never spilled milk in the car. My cousin recently bought a used Accord from just such an individual. I'm still looking for that car.  "

"nippononly","July 2006"," can sell SUVs right now.

"fintail","July 2006"," Seeing my trade languish on a lot was a big reason why I sold my last car privately. It would greatly annoy me to see a car I once cherished to be wasting away on a lot, or to be purchased by someone for their 16 year old daughter etc. I had to make sure I had a good home for the old thing.Speaking of matchbox cars, I was a chronic matchbox buyer through the end of last year or so, when I finally had about all I wanted (and could fit on my shelf). I have a few pics at carspace , scarily I actually have a few more I bought since I took the pics. "
"guss","July 2006"," know why, but I always like the Hot Wheels better than the Match box cars. I think they had more racy with the big tires and better colors. Funny thing is I remember them being .99 cents 35 years ago($1.05 with Maryland sales tax). I buy them now for my 3 year old son and they are still .99 cents. I guess China has at least figured out how to make our tiny cars for cheap.Fintail, are those really Matchbox cars, I don't remember them being that big. "
"fintail","July 2006"," Yeah, Matchbox didn't get free rolling wheels until about 1970, and the cars were still usually more sedate - reflecting what was on the (mainly British) road at the time rather than imagination.I remember when I was little, in maybe the early 80s, they were also 99 cents, and I could usually con one per week or 2 out of my parents. There were also ""Pocket Cars"" from Japan by Tomy sold at that time, which were very detailed but fragile compared to the others.The pics are the first series of Matchbox cars primarily from 1955-1960. Almost all of them are about the size of modern ones, ca 1:60 scale. "
"jefferyg","July 2006"," I wasn't saying that they never place another brand on their used lot. I was just saying that they are far more likely to put a Honda on the Honda lot.We traded an 03 Civic EX in on the 06 Passat. I know that the dealer sold our car themselves rather than wholesaling it. However, I think that was largely due to the fact that since my brother worked at the dealership, they put more into our trade than they probably would into someone else's. Basically they couldn't afford to wholesale our car, and being a Honda in excellent shape and super clean inside, out, and under the hood, they knew they would eventually get their money back out of it.

We had both Hot Wheels and Matchbox, but I think what propelled Hot Wheels to prominence was not so much the cars, but all the tracks and launchers you could get from Hot Wheels. With my brother and I it didn't really matter which brand of car you had, you just wanted the fastest one. We used to sit for hours pulling the handles on our ""Thundershift 500"" racetrack. We'd race about ten laps until the plastic curve came apart and we'd fix it back then race some more. I still like to get in the floor with my son and play with his Hot Wheels racetracks. It's just that now getting back up out of the floor is not so easy. :sick: Oh, to be a kid again.  "
"akangl","July 2006"," Hubby's V10 would sit for a while and have a birthday on the Dodge dealer's lot, they had 2 others that already had plus 4 or 5 others that had been there a while.

When we bought it from the Ford dealer 3 years ago it had only been there for 2 days.My Titan is still there and Zippy is still sitting at the used car dealer I sold her to. I'm sad for Zippy, I kind of miss her, but after getting the Sebring I didn't drive her at all. "
"qbrozen","July 2006"," The quickest sold was our '03 Pilot. They sold it before the dealer even got our plates in. But they did put it on their lot for only $1k more than they gave us for it. As far as I know, anything else I traded in went to auction ... at least that's what the dealers said they would do with it. I usually don't check.The longest probably will be the Lincoln LS I traded in a couple of months ago to a Honda dealer. They have it listed for the same price I paid for it 9 months prior ... and I got it with a certified warranty from a Lincoln dealer. The asking price is also $2500 above what I was trying to sell it myself for, but got zero bites. "
"british_rover","July 2006"," I have pre-sold tradeins before. Took a tradein one day and turned around and sold it the very next day a couple of times.Normally our used cars have a shelf life of 60 days and anything older then that goes to the auction no matter what. Sometimes that is stretched to 90 days but not normally. "
"qbrozen","July 2006"," here's my question, BR ... do you start lowering your asking price at any time? I find that most dealers, on average, ask about $4k over trade-in value. Do you stick to $4k over and then send it to auction after 60 days? "
"british_rover","July 2006"," Typically yes we will lower our prices some as the 60, or 90 day depending on the vehicle, shelflife approaches on the vehicle.I have sold used cars at pretty big loses just to avoid them going to auction where will take an even bigger loss. We have even sold a couple of used rovers to people for less then we would get at the auction just to earn another retail customer and their service business.

The following Wednesday they sold the two vehicles in question at auction, both for low $14s (I have a small-time dealer friend who lets me use his password).At the same Acura dealer a couple of years earlier, I bought a Pathfinder for $7,500 when wholesale was probably close to $7,000, so go figure.

"woodyww","July 2006"," If this place will p/u & deliver the car for service appt's (it sounds like?), why don't you just do that from now on? It seems like 1/2 of the hassle (besides the car not being fixed) was all the waiting & bs when you went to p/u the car.If you don't have another car to use, it'd almost be worth it to pay Enterprise for a few days rental. I find schlepping the car to the service dept. back & forth can add greatly to the aggrevation, esp. if it's some distance. If something's not fixed, I resent it more if I've sat in traffic, etc. "
"fintail","July 2006"," They had those accessories when I was a kid too, or I would pick them up at local yard sales. On the cars though...I guess I was an odd kid, as I liked the models that were more unusual or detailed. I took pretty good care of my cars and still have a box of them, but many did get destroyed by my brother. There were also ""Majorette"" cars sold back in the day, from France. Many Euro cars, which pleased me greatly. Hot Wheels had a well-proportioned Mercedes W126 which was one of my favorites.About bargaining on cars over time...I bought my old 126 from a MB dealer, and my initial offer was slightly more than half their asking price. Of course they balked...so I added a little more, told them they'll keep it forever or sell it to me now...and the next day they called and it was mine. They had had it around for awhile, but rarely on the lot as it wasn't new enough I guess. "
"guss","July 2006"," I have to admit that I have done the drive around to the dealers back lot on a Sunday routine. It seems most people will complete their transaction on a Saturday so the service dept. has not had time to do any cleaning of the vehicle yet.That way you get to see it in it's natural state before any odors or scratchs get covered up. Also you get around paying the dealer re conditioning fees that I usually end up re doing anyway. "
"corvette","July 2006"," They were/are actually willing to deliver a loaner to me, pick up my car, and drive it back. I may ask for that in the future, but I needed to be in the area anyway.

"fintail","July 2006"," That's how I found my C43...I heard about the car sitting on a storagelot a few blocks from the dealership...I inquired, and the rest is history. The car never hit the lot. I also got to see the car in its pre-dealer-detail state, which is indeed good knowledge to have. I could tell the car was honest.The day I picked it up I spent a few hours detailing it, even though they washed and waxed it. "
"woodyww","July 2006"," Well, there's 2 good things happening: that they will p/u & deliver the car for service (& this is not even the selling dealer?--that's rare), & you get to drive other bmw's while they have it. Hopefully, the loaners won't break on you (sorry, a little sick bmw humor).I was going to suggest that you either trade the thing in on an acura, or that you go into the bmw service dept. with a couple of really big, nasty looking friends, & 3 baseball bats, but it sounds like there's hope they will straighten things out.....good luck, enjoy the X3 "
"corvette","July 2006"," Agreed, they are trying to redeem themselves, and yes, I'm very glad that some dealerships offer a loaner to customers who bought their car elsewhere. I did solicit their business when I ordered the car, but none of the nearby dealers were offering much (if any) discount on a pre-order 2006 3-series. I have been offered a job to practice law if and when I pass the bar (after I take it in 2007). The closest BMW dealer is 45 miles away, and the second-closest one (Swope) is about 70. "

It came with the ION we just picked up for our daughter and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. Right now we get the ""Safe and Sound"" package for the first year, then it's $16.95/mo after that. She also gets 30 free phone minutes for the first 2 months and there is an introductory offer of $14.99 for an additional 100 minutes. Now, compared to our cell phone plan, that's pretty expensive, but since the kid doesn't use her cell phone in the car, it might be a good way to keep track of her when she's commuting to/from college.

If you're putting on a lot of miles, would you consider buying a (different) brand you could run up to 100K miles or so w/o worrying too much about repairs? "
"perna","July 2006"," 1) The L300 only has 16 payments left on it, and then it'll be mine. It has less than 50K on it, though I'm adding miles at the rate of 1300-1500 per month. I dropped my '03 Maxima, with 34k miles on it off at the dealer today to get its oil changed. I made the mistake of sitting in a '07 Max.. man, did they fix the seats. I always felt like my car's seats were just a touch too narrow, well, they widened it out a good 3-4"" or so. The interior is greatly improved over the '04-'06 as well. It was easily better than the Acura TL I looked at back in January (Auto Show). It was weird, I actually got a BMW vibe.. probably because the interior was completely jet-black. The TL and previous Maximas had all kinds of titanium/silver accents inside. The whole thing felt substantial and really well put together. The weirdest thing was looking in the cupholder, and seeing only a keyfob. On the dash was this thing you turn to start the engine.. no key required! Too bad my wife is 1. having a baby next month (for a total of 2), and 2. buying a new car next year, since the lease on her Explorer will be up. Kids are the ultimate CCB cure, although it's funny you all were talking Hot Wheels/Matchbox a few posts back. My 2 YO had been stealing cars from his daycare, so when we went grocery shopping on Saturday I let him pick out a couple plus a playset. The (Matchbox, ironically the Hot Wheels playsets were junk) playset came with a Jeep Commander, and he selected two Matchbox cars. Out of the dozens of cars he had to choose from, he picked two differently colored Audi TTs. Let's just say I'm glad I opened his college savings account last month, LOL!One strange thing I noticed is that Mattel now makes Matchbox AND Hot Wheels. I wonder when they bought the company, and more importantly, why they still make both. "
"qbrozen","July 2006"," CCBA vs. fiscal responsibility. Man, what a dilemma.Yup. That's the standard problem we all face (well, unless some here are ridiculously wealthy). I went through this decision a few months ago and decided to swap for the lease. I've been avoiding it for so long, thinking that I was being smart by buying my cars ... but no matter what I buy, I can't seem to keep it for more than a few years, so what am I really saving? As a matter of fact, I think it was costing me more. So we'll see how the leasing goes. Here is a pro you may have missed, though. You pretty much HAVE to keep the car throughout the lease period (or incur a major hit to the wallet). What I mean is, with the last 3 cars I purchased, none stayed in my stable for more than 9 months. So the lease will force me to keep the car longer.  "
"michaellno","July 2006"," I've been down the lease road before, so I'm well aware of the issues you mention. To do a lease, I'd have to get 15K of miles per year.Ironically, the local chain of AutoNation dealerships here in Denver (under the John Elway brand name) is currently offering 110% of NADA book on all trades.Looked up the L300 on the nada website and came up with a trade value of 11725 - 110% of that is 12897. I owe about 7400 on it, so I've got about 5400 in equity.Elway has the following brands:BuickChevroletChryslerDodgeFordGMCHondaHyundaiJeepMazdaNissanPontiacScionSubaruToyotaThinking about buying instead of leasing to get around the mileage limitation and to get a car that is now in warranty.woody - yep, the L is what just had $1800 worth of repairs in the past few months.Options just got a whole lot more complicated.

It pulled up all sorts of crap that the old one was completely missing. It seems pretty well constructed so it should last as longer than the car, I hope. "
"michaellno","July 2006"," I washed the L yesterday too and, while driving around at lunch today, I'm inclined to keep it.

After graduating college in 1985, I bought a year old Accord and have had a car payment ever since. Is that a sign of a true CCB?The other motivation to keep the car is to have some extra money to (perhaps) buy a larger house in the next couple of years. Of course, with the daughter heading off to college in a few weeks, it will be just the wife and I, and how much house does a couple really need? We've also thought about buying the kid a townhouse or condo up in Ft. Collins as an investment ....But, I gotta admit, it's fun to look online. And with a bunch of dealers not more than a 10 minute drive from my office, I can always check something out in person if the desire strikes. "

That's $347.66 per month I haven't had to shell out for car payments. And if you add up everything I've had to put in the car since the final payment, with the exception of gas and insurance, I doubt if I've had to put $500 into it since then. "
"michaellno","July 2006"," Yeah, I keep thinking that same way about the L. With 49K on the clock now and averaging about 1400 miles a month, I figure it will have 70-75K on it when the last payment is made.If (and it's a big if) everything holds together and it doesn't need any more big $$$ repairs, another couple of years after that would put me around 105K.At that point, the VUE will be close to being paid off - we went with the 6 year loan as the wife is the anti-CCB; I know she'll keep her car for 10 years if we take care of it.Again, one of the things that I like about the Saturn is that the side panels won't have any door dings or anything like that. Keep 'em clean and change the fluids regularly ought to do just fine.Should I renounce my membership?OTOH, I priced out an ION Quad Coupe. For under $20K, I can get the 170HP 2.4 engine, sunroof, ABS/TC, stick shift and XM radio.

Best car I ever owned.I've been stuck in the ""i'll never lease again"" mentality for so long now that I wasn't realizing the kind of penalties I was incurring by buying and trading so often. I have been buying used, though, so that was helping somewhat. Actually, the Accord is my first brand new car since I leased my last vehicle ('99 Mazda 626). Anyway, as I mentioned before, I'm hoping that the restrictions of leasing will serve me 2-fold. One is that I get to look for another vehicle in 3 years, without guilt. Two is that I have to WAIT 3 years for another vehicle.  "
"graphicguy","July 2006"," q....I know how I am. The TL isn't a bad car. Matter of fact, it's quite good. I'm reserving my manual transmission buying to cars like the Mustang (I'm on the list at my local Ford dealer to have right of first refusal on a GT500), or a Porsche...or a 'vette.I can't get over the FWD ""quirks"" after having RWD cars for so long. Every time I ""air it out"", that tug in the steering wheel makes me nuts. The manual tranny would have just exascerbated the issue. NOthing anyone can do about it. It's the nature of the beast.While the TL is no slouch when it comes to the luxury dept, the German iron seems to be in a whole other league. Drove an A6 V8 last night. Mercy! It's a big heavy car, but man can it scoot. Fit/finish and materials are also in a different league, too. Audi is going through some questionable reliablity concerns, though.The BMW 330i has all that, is just as fast, but smaller (which appeals to me). Plus, it seems very connected to the driver. I don't know what the differences are between the earlier versions of I-Drive and the one on the 330i, but it's better to use than the navi on the TL. I don't have to take my eyes off the road to use it. Fit/finish and materials are most impressive. Ride/handling trade-off is just about perfect. No maintenance charges, either.Lexus IS 350 is the fastest of the bunch, but everything else disappoints. It rides hard. Handling, while good, isn't any better than the TL (except for no torque steer). I've driven two of them. Both had rattles galore....the first one only had 8 miles on it, too....quite unlike Lexus. It's a bit smaller (by my feel) than the 330i (IS is almost too small).I'll lose about $800 and change on the TL. I bought it ""right"" when new....current model. It only has 7K miles on it. Got a neighbor who wants to buy it from me. He knows I only keep my cars for about a year (sometimes less) and keep them in tip-top shape.Audi dealer is offering $9K off on the A6 (i guess they are trying to clear the '06s off the lot....he's only got 3 left). BMW is a little harder to deal with....about $2,500 off the 330i (but lower sticker).The vaunted Lexus dealer experience has been a disappointment for me. The IS 350 cost about the same as the 330i comparing MSRP. But, you'd think they were dealing in precious metals when trying to get a good deal. It's not like they don't have at least 8 of them sitting on the lot (they do...the've been sitting there for about a month and only sold one of them).I'm getting 3-4 phone calls a day from the different dealers trying to coax me back into their showrooms.Right now, I'm leaning towards the 330i, with the Audi as 2nd choice.Probably do something this weekend.You liking the Accord? What model did you get? Options?I leased once a long time ago. After getting through with all the disposal fees, lessor fees, getting dinged for the smallest of paint chips, I swore I'd never do it again. I couldn't believe I had to pay nearly $1,000 just for the privilege of sending the car back to the leasing company. "
"qbrozen","July 2006"," Yeah, i've heard good and bad with lease terminations. Its all about the institution, I suppose. I know, for instance, my wife's Mitsubishi was a pain to get rid of. Honda has a specific clause in their contract about how much damage is allowed, etc. So I'm hoping it goes well 3 years from now.Have you checked out the G35? RWD, stick, and a touch of luxo. Might fit the bill, and at a whole lot less than the audi/bmw. But, then again, you might not find it so nice inside. They seem to have put more in the chassis than the details to keep the price down.My accord is the 6-speed, so my only choice was Nav or no nav (much like the TL). I like the Nav, but couldn't justify $40 per month extra. So I went without.funny you mentioned the RWD thing. I almost went into it in my last post, but stopped. here's my problem ... I was quite happy with the Volvo. But it got a bit old and I got a big raise at work, so my wife figured it was Ok for me to get a fun car and keep the volvo for bad weather, etc. In comes the 350Z. I don't think we need to rehash my love of that car. Anyway, in comes baby, out goes Z, and in comes Lincoln LS. I keep the RWD, keep the low off-the-line torque, but give up the stick and give up good gas mileage. Hmmmm... I come to find out I'm not quite so happy about that decision. So out goes Lincoln and in comes the Accord. HUGE improvement in gas mileage, get back my stick, its even faster than the Lincoln, etc. BUT ... I'm really missing RWD now. I never thought I'd say it, but its true. The Z and the LS showed me what I'd been missing all these years. Not to mention, launching the Accord perfectly is damned hard. A bit too low in the revs and it feels like a 4-cylinder. A bit too high and the front wheel just spins and hops. Don't get me wrong, its a great car, and I think I can be content through the lease.

"stickguy","July 2006"," I really thought I would finally get back into a RWD car with my last purchases (Scion tC that became a 4 cyl 5 speed Accord 1.5 years later). I looked, but in the end couldn't justify the cost differential (purchase price and gas too).The Accord was a deal, about 20K for an EX-L that has pretty much all the goodies I care about. It drives OK for FWD, but mostly because it isn't overly powerful. I did drive a TL 6 speed once, and that baby was a handful when you nailed it, especially in a turn or in the wet.someone really needs to come out with a compact sporty RWD sedan for around 20-25K, basically the Accord price points. THe best hope now might be GM of all companies, if they decide to use the SOlstice platform (Kappa?) for a sedan.A BMW 1 series would be interesting if the brought over the 5 door, depending on price..beyond that, you are up in the 30s (sometimes way up), unless I am forgetting some option.

The plant in Delaware is cranking out all the convertibles the market can absorb at the moment.Hmm, 20K for an EX-L Accord?

"graphicguy","July 2006"," q...stickguy.....I looked at the G35. Nice car. Similar to the Z (at least in coupe form). As you point out, I thought the interior was ""cheezy"". I actually liked the interior of the Z better. Build quality wasn't very impressive for the price either (had the radio knob fall off during the test drive....I know, probably was an isolated thing, but still......). I was more interested in the M, though. It's a big step up in driving dynamics, build/materials over the G.Probably my lack of experience with FWD, but I never could get a decent launch with the TL and was always aware of the steering wheel tug, even when I was expecting it. Aside from that, I think the Accord V6 driving dynamics would be very similar to the TL. Nice materials inside....built well....had all the toys in it.First impressions of the german iron was ""craftmanship"" when I looked inside and out. I don't know if the materials are actually better in a BMW or Audi compared to a Lexus, but it certainly seemed that way to me. Leather felt better. Controls operated with a precision feel. The Audi and BMW just feel better. It's definitely a step up compared to the TL. Even the wood in the BMW and Audi looks and feels better compared to what I observed in both the M series and the IS. That doesn't even begin to touch on the superior driving dynamics and the superior ride/handling of the German marks over the Lexus. the Infiniti M gets a little closer as does the GS series for Lexus (but now you are entering a negotiated price near $50K).This price segment is as crowded with good cars as the segment the Accord, Camry, etc compete in.Looking in the price range, which I define as the high $30s-low $40s...there's the BMW 330i, Audi A6 (with big discounts right now), IS 350, M35, Benz C series....6 cyl (which I crossed off my list almost immediately after the test drive)....Caddy STS (surprisingly competent and big discounts now, too). No clunkers with any of them.Still, I've narrowed it down to the A6 and 330i.True about lease terms. I would imagine what is/isn't allowed would vary by financial institution. But, even after I negotiate my best deal, I got hit with aquisition fees, bank fees, etc up front. And then disposition fees, wear and tear fees, etc on the back end. It didn't make my ""good deal"" look so good any more.Hope to pull the trigger on something this week. "

"anonymousposts","July 2006"," He gives you the certified check or cash. You pay your bank off, they send you the title, and once you receive the title sign it over. In the meantime you both sign a bill of sale that states the title will be released once the loan is PIF. If you bank at a local branch go in with the cash and see if they can give you the title then. It's really going to depend on who your bank is. "

"graphicguy","July 2006"," woody....my car ownership in the past 2.5+ years confuses me, too.....LOL!Here's are the cars I've had in that period of time....--'04 Mazda RX8 (dandy car....tons of fun....). Rear ended by an F series pickup that was ""jacked up"". My RX8 was totaled as a result. I got the insurance check.--'05 Mustang GT....fast and fun. Bought it (actually ordered it), all loaded up, with the exception of an automatic transmission for $25.5K (X-plan). This was when Ford could not keep up with demand. Got one of the first ones delivered to my area. Kept it 9 mos and about 6K miles. Turned around and sold it for $27K....$1,500 more than I paid for it.--'05 Acura TL w/Nav. Nice car. Had all the bells and whistles. Good power. But, FWD....that drove me nuts. Wasn't really thinking about selling it until the neighbor of the guy who bought my Mustang (knowing how I change cars with the same frequency as Paris Hilton changes boyfriends) said ""....let me know when you want to sell the Acura..."". We tossed around some numbers to see if he was serious. He was. I had bought the TL for $31.9 as the '06s were rolling on the lot. Sold that for $31K and change. It still smelled new.I've still got a 4Runner I'm using as a daily driver and my son, who's 20 and living at home as a college student, has a Hyundai Elantra (which, after 4 years of ownership is proving to be a very good and reliable vehicle). I use the 4Runner for Home Depot duty and to tow a couple of SeeDoos.With the TL gone, the Audi A6Q 3.2 (which is being discounted about $9K around these parts) and the 330i (which is being discounted about $2,500) are both in the same price ballpark, are the leading replacement vehicles. Neither of those are FWD, of course.I love the way the 330i drives. I'm having a hard time dismissing the ""clearance"" discount on the A6, though. 330i is a smaller car, but that's not an issue for me (bachelor with no kids to haul around).From what I've read, Audi has gone through a little bout of reliability issues lately. But, they offer no cost maintenance. The Audi dealership offers pick-up and delivery service at no charge, too.The 330i dealership offers the same as the Audi dealership as far as pick-up & delivery, plus they offer loaner cars at no charge, too. From what I've read, BMW's bugaboos have more to do with people not understanding the I-Drive than anything else. Personally, after having a nav system in the TL, I find the I-Drive better since you don't have to take your eyes off the road to operate it (it uses a little knob between the seats that falls readily to my hand). Audi's is similar.Regarding the GT500, I put my name on my dealership's list for one way back when they were first announced. I've since seen one a couple of times at the auto shows. The dealership will give my ""rights of first refusal"". At the proposed selling price of $39K-$40K, I might be interested. Since that time, there are stories about Ford upping production of them (making them less collectible). And, I don't think for a minute that dealerships are going to sell them anywhere near the MSRP price (way higher). So, I probably won't be a buyer. "

"graphicguy","July 2006"," ky...went with Jake.Both dealerships are good, as you know. Jake was a little more generous with the discounts (about $200 more generous) and had what I was interested in color/options wise.Felt badly about telling the sales guy at the Store about my decision about an hour or so, ago. He really did try very hard to find what I wanted and to ""make the deal"". But, we hit a wall over that last $200.Bottom line, the kicker was probably talking to the SM at Jake's place. My sales person has the day off. SM was calling me (at the request of the sales person) for a ""yay"" or ""nay"" on their latest offer. We were within a couple hundred of where the deal needed to be. I told the SM over the phone that if they could come down $200 and throw in mats and the wood shifter/brake handle I'd be inclined to buy from them. He said, without hesitation....""We were already being aggresive before on the price, but I can do that"". We verbally went over all the numbers on the phone and agreed.Told him to have it written up and ready for delivery after work today. He said everything would be ready.For those of you who don't know what kyfdx and I are talking about, there are two BMW dealerships in our area (SW Ohio/northern KY)....one is Jake Sweeney BMW and the other one is called, ironically, The BMW Store.

"graphicguy","July 2006"," woody....it's a 330i with the sport package (love the seats). I got the I-Drive navi, which some will crown me heretical, but I consider it better than the navi in the Acura. Lux package, cold weather package. 6-speed automatic (I know, others will beat me for this, but I found it to be the best ""sport"" automatic tranny I've found). Plus, either it's my advanced age (40s) or pure laziness, I find I'm quite liking modern auto transmissions these days (especially those as good as this one). Comfort access (a bit frivolous, but it was on the car, already). It allows you to keep the key fob in your pocket and just ""push"" a start/stop button to....well....start and stop the engine (it does some other stuff, too...like just touch the door to lock and unlock it, same with the trunk...set the mirrors and seats to my prefered position as I open the car door, etc).I didn't get the active steering. Test drove one with active steering, but I found I liked the standard steering better. I didn't get the ""pro-active"" cruise control, either (where it sets a certain distance to those cars around you, and holds that distance by accelerating and braking). Thought that was more than just a little intrusive, too. Regular cruise works just fine for me.Lesse....oh yeah, it comes with a year's worth of Sirius. I liked the XM in my TL. We'll see if I like the Sirius enough to renew the subscription after a year. Stereo is the fancy shamnzy Lexicon Logic 7 (surround sound). It's a dandy.Ummm...it's black saphire metallic (sparkly black) with ""terra cotta"" interior (chocolate) and poplar real wood trim.It had 8 miles on it the last time I test drove it.

"gee35coupe","July 2006"," Not that I'm arguing...But I'm trying to figure out why you have to take your eyes of the road to use the TL's NAV. I have the TSX with the same system. You have steering wheel and/or voice controls for the radio, climate, phone and NAV. Just curious....... "
"british_rover","July 2006"," I was wondering that too. I have sold a couple of TL's and TSX's used and I was very impressed with how easy it was to use the Nav system. The larger screen and scroll/joystick type nob down in the center console makes it even easier to use then the Rover nav system. "
"graphicguy","July 2006"," TLs have the ""touch screen"". I had to avert my eyes from the road to use it. Not saying the Acura system is bad (it's quite good), just that I had to look at the screen for touchscreen duties. Of course, all of these systems use voice commands, also....which does away with the need for any interaction.....with a knob or a touchscreen.With the I-Drive, all I have to do is to use a voice command (for...let's say radio funcions) and use the ""knob"" to scroll through the stations I want...then just push the knob to select the one that suits me.Not as easy as using pushbuttons on a radio, but with about 12 different stations for each mode (AM, FM, Sirius, etc) it makes choices a bit easier. Manually putting in addresses for Nav is a bit easier, too with the I-Drive. Using the touch screen to ""type"" in an address was a bit more cumbersome than using the knob to spell a name.Not having to push a button for every command I spoke is a nice touch in the I-Drive. In the Acura, I would activate the voice commands by hitting a button on the steering wheel. Any subsequent voice commands (like simple ""yes"" or ""no"" commands) required me to press the voice command button again (which I often forgot to do....I would just bark out the next command without touching the button again...that did nothing). On I-Drive, I press one button for a voice command and subsequent commands don't require me to touch it again.I-Drive allows me to display more than one function, too (TL does not). I can have my map and my CD functions, for example, displayed in a split screen. With the TL, it was one or the other, not both.Having a Nav system previously, my learning curve on this one was very brief. If I never had one before, I'd find any of them to be intimidating. "
"kyfdx","July 2006"," Bimmer = car.. pronounced just the way it looks..Beemer = motorcycle.. ditto...That said, nearly everyone refers to the cars as ""Beemers"".. I even do it myself.. Congrats on the new 330i!! I'm extremely jealous....  "
"gee35coupe","July 2006"," That actually prefers I-drive. That's just a new one to me. Personally, I try not to ever touch my screen. All stereo controls can be accessed by voice or steering wheel. The TL has the Audio and temperature information always displayed on the separate display above the screen. Having that information on the screen is optional. The Honda/Acura NAV is almost as much an industry standard as the 3-series' handling.Additionally the TL's surround stereo is also regarded as one of the best in its class...http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/list/top10/101037/article.htmlBut hey.....that's why there are so many different cars out there. Cause if someone gave me a BMW I'd trade it for something else. I'm not a big fan of German interiors. Well, I might keep a M-series or a 6MT V8 one. But they have thier own advantages. "
"graphicguy","July 2006"," ky....you've got nothing to be jealous of.....you've got a BMW convertible. I'm the one who is jealous.Gee35....I think the first iteration of I-Drive in the 7 series was the one that was much maligned. Never used that one. I believe the one in the E90 is a bit different.We all have our personal preferences. I prefer a split screen for all of the functions over having the TL's info at the top of the screen. That doesn't make one way better than the other, though.All of these navi units can be daunting to the people who are new to them. They can't be totally mastered with a brief test drive, either. Are any of them as easy to use as just push buttons to change a radio station? Nope! But, their capabilities far exceed what was available even a couple of years ago.I was very ready to buy a 3 series without navi and save myself a couple grand. Once I spent a little time with it, I was hooked.Last night, I spent about 30 minutes with the owners maual and I-Drive for familiarization and customization while in my garage. I like it more now, than I did before. Driving from the dealership home, I used the navi to see how accurate and routing would be. It was very good. Not a real testament, but my TLs navi put me in a circuitous route during the same drive. I think the navi in the TL was a clarion. I don't know who makes the navi for BMW.Regarding the stereo, I liked the one in my TL. I found it fatiguing at times because it was just a bit underpowered (and the panasonic digital amps Acura uses are known to be a bit harsh), but it was good, nonetheless. As a point of reference, I thought the Martin Logan stereo in the Lexus IS 350 to be a bit harsh. That could be because the IS uses metal drivers in their speakers....those are known for their harshness.Bottom line, these stock units are all very good....certainly better than stock units of even a few years ago.I consider the Lexicon (division of Harmon Kardin) Logic 7 stereo in the 330i to be a step up from the TL. Lexicon is known for more ""accuracy"" in their amps, though. BMW puts the sub woofers under the seats, so I can feel as well as hear the lower octaves. Bass isn't as muddy as it was in the TL. The only downside is that the 330i won't play DVD-A disks. That said, I don't own any DVD-A disks (with the exception of the one that came with my TL). So, that wasn't an issue for me. DVD-A seems to be going away, anyway. Those disks are hard to find with any of the music I'm interested in, anyway.Lexicon's Logic 7 simulates surround sound from 2-channel sources. Plus, I was able to plug in my i-pod to the BMW (couldn't do that with the TL). "

I haven't heard the Mark Levinson in a Lexus, but I drove a LX470 once with the Nakamichi system, the best car audio system I've ever heard (I should have bought the vehicle based on that alone).The stereo in my 6 y.o. 5 series is.......""OK""....., nothing great, but I really like the CD changer. I have great FM stations in my area, & what the stereo lacks are ""sins of Omission, not Comission"".

And the Mark Levinson I heard in the IS at the ""Taste of Lexus"" event was quite good too. But I listen to mostly techno, house and ambient anyway.I used to transport cars for Carmax and have driven a few Bimmer cross country. I never have been impressed my thier stereos.

"bottgers","July 2006"," I even tried contacting the host about this issue, but I haven't heard from him. "
"lilengineerboy","July 2006"," One issue with touch screen is there is no tactile feedback (although that is changing right now) and the button always requires a glance, where as a hard button (hard control)in a fixed location becomes a balistic movement after a little training (you muscles don't think about from going from the gas to the brake, and your body doesn't check to see if your foot got there). The reach to the radio preset buttons on a car you drive often is also pretty well learned.Eyes off road time when goofing around with in-vehicle systems is a very real concern. This concerns can be mitigated by using other modalities (voice, etc) Brain off road time when goofing around with in-vehicle systems or cell phones may be a bigger concern with few, if any, work-arounds.

"graphicguy","July 2006"," rocky....sorry about that. I was actually sitting in Logan airport when I wrote that. Must have been something subliminal. The IS stereo is a Mark LEVINSON. My synapses must have misfired when I wrote that.Car stereos are funny. We've all run into people that have paid more for their car stereos than their entire car is worth.Some of these factory systems are becoming very good. They are designed by some of the most respected names in the audio industry (like Levinson, Lexicon, etc). Being something of a home audio ""nut"", I appreciate the efforts. What one person prefers over another is infinitely variable. Go to a home theater or audio WEB site and you'll see how many companies are actually in the audio biz. You'll also find endless debates on which amplifier or speaker technology is better than others. It's all personal opinion, though.These Nav systems were once only the province of the very high end in cars. Now, I can get a portable unit at Circuit City for less than $500. Some of them are very good. I travel a lot and use a Garmin NUVI to use in rental cars. It is excellent as a GPS. It also plays MP3s. It's dismal at that function. Consequently, the Nav system in my previous RX8 was poor (it used a knob for navigation, too). That was only 3 years ago. The ones I've seen in use in cars today are worlds better than that one.Where some of these integrated navi systems get into trouble is when the car manufacturers figure out they can cram many other functions into them by just programming their electronics into them. Heck, I can check my oil levels, see how much pad is left on my brake pads, etc through the unit I have. I can see what they're trying to do. I'm certain it costs less for a manufacturer to cram all these functions into a screen than it is to manufacture more knobs and parts for the same function.None of these units offer features that you can grasp via a brief explanation by the sales person. Spend some time reading the manual and doing a bit of hands on yields great results, however. I just realized last night that I can use a voice command to speak an address and the navi will take me right to it.I'm all about ""technology"" because that happens to be my career. I'm the guy who actually knew how to program my VCR so it wouldn't flash ""12:00"" all the time. If you dismiss the technology out of hand after a few minutes as being too complex, you'll be disappointed. Conversely, spend a little time with the manual and a little time doing some hands-on, they are pretty amazing in their capabilities, usefullness and functionality. "
"graphicguy","July 2006"," Probably the most used fucntion of these systems is ""blue tooth"" to pair with a blue tooth phone. For better or worse, cell phones are now a way of life. With blue tooth and voice recognition, you can call or receive a call while driving and never take your eyes from the road or you hands from the steering wheel.Acura has blue tooth capability as does BMW. I've read where some blue tooth phones won't ""pair"" with in car systems. I've got a Motorola phone, and it paired easily with both Acura and the BMW.Voice commands are the key to keeping your hands on the steering wheel and your eyes on the road. Change the radio station? Just say the command. Make a phone call? Again, say the command. There are voice commands for everything from changing the temperature, to playing a CD.I do reach down to my ""knob"" to scan radio stations. But, that's about the only time I take my right hand off the steering wheel. I can do that function via voice command too, though. It can also be done on the steering wheel buttons.What scares me most is the folks who ""hack"" these navi systems to play DVD movies on the navi screen. They've got surround sound alreayd installed via the stereo system. It's like they've got a rolling theater. I can't fathom why they would want to do that (and yes, I've heard all the excuses of how they want to keep little ""johnny"" entertained while driving). But, that would be a huge distraction. Yet, people insist on doing that. I've encountered these folks on the road....can see the ""movie"" playing on their nav screen. They're all by themselves, too. Personally, I think the penalties should be an automatic license suspension to anyone who does that. "
"lilengineerboy","July 2006"," My first experience with voice activation was the Clarion ""AutoPC"" from the late 90s/early 00s.

"corvette","August 2006"," I got my car back today. They replaced something called the ""intelligent battery sensor."" Mine wasn't very intelligent, because it was causing the A/C fan to cut out and preventing the radio from operating in accessory mode. I also suspect it was to blame for the residual heat function not working, but we'll have to wait until winter to know for sure. There are still some ticks and rattles in the cabin, but they're better than before.When they pulled the car around, I got inside, started adjusting the seat, and discovered a plastic panel in the passenger side floorboard. I brought it back inside and the service advisor reinstalled it--it was the fuse cover in the glovebox. I've never had occasion to remove it before, so I wasn't certain that was what it was. I'm happy I don't have to worry about the aircon cutting out. But, the fact that it spent nineteen days out of service in its first thirteen months of ownership will probably factor heavily into ownership decisions as it approaches the end of its warranty. It's also vexing that the radio problem was present from the day that I got it a little over a year ago--it seems like something that should have been caught at the factory or during the Performance Center's pre-delivery inspection.

"woodyww","August 2006"," Maybe it's related to being the first-year of a new model? I remember that the '97 5-series had more problems than later years of that version.ticks and rattles--& radio problems--nineteen days out of service--I probably would be way more frustrated than you, if I had spent around $40K (?) on a brand new car.I've owned 2 bmw's, & knock wood, both were built like tanks, including the interiors. The late 80's 6-series started having problems at around 10 years old, altho probably nothing unusual for a 10 y.o. car. My current one, a 2000 5-series (& I don't want to tempt fate by bragging about it), has had 3 minor problems in 6 years, & definitely no ticks and rattles. Again, it seems extremely solid & well built, like you imagine an expensive German car should be. Honestly, If I were you, I'd be thinking of selling it sooner, rather than later--the depreciation curve on most bmw's is not good as the years go by. Esp. if the hassles are starting to weigh on you. I'd rather have a TL, or RDX, even if they're not quite as fun to drive.....Just my 2 cents, woody "
"corvette","August 2006"," You make some very good points, and, yes, I am disappointed in the fact that the car spent so long out of service. If I had everything to do over again, I would make some changes. I would probably (gasp) get an automatic. I like driving a manual on a desolate, twisty road, but the other 98% of the time, it doesn't matter so much, and it's occasionally a hassle. I think I want satnav. I'd also like to have something I wouldn't feel guilty about parking outside the garage if/when I need to, but I suspect I'd feel that way with most near-luxury cars (Acura, Lexus, etc). I've driven some form of sporty/luxury sedan (plus a Grand Am coupe) for most of my driving career, save the brief stint in the Canyon pickup. I think I'd like to try a small or mid-size SUV next time, but I'd still like something that feels sporty. "

"jaserb","August 2006"," I been shoppin' Since the beater Dodge Ram died we've been down to basically one functional vehicle - the 2004 Mazda MPV - which has been a pain, but we've made do. Since then I got the Alfa Spider running again, thanks to a complete engine rebuild in my garage, including conversion from the nasty mechanical fuel injection to nice reliable Webers. But I still needed a new commuter for when we move to northern Virginia next week. And the wife made me promise NO MORE BEATERS!While I was out at our new place for work I started car shopping. I started out looking for used Civic Hybrids, since there are tax / HOV benefits to hybrids where we're moving. Driving them reminded me that I just don't get the Honda thing. Plus, I've gotten used to having a little pickup for hauling around car parts, lawn stuff, bikes, etc.I've had my eye out on a 2002-2004 Ext cab. 2WD Mazda B2300. They have the excellent 2.3L motor from the Mazda3 / Mazda6, the little jump seats so it will seat the whole family in a pinch, and fantastic gas mileage - 24/29, which is as good as it gets in a pickup. Most ext cabs (including all Ford Rangers) have the rotten 3.0L Vulcan. Reliable, but horrible. I think you gain only 5 HP or so over the 4 cyl but you lose like 6 MPG!So I find a nice B2300 Ext Cab, about 50 miles from our new place. 2004, 17k miles, Cruise, A/C, CD, kind of a metallic sand color with grey guts. Nice, clean truck. The seller is a very nice lady in her late 50s / early 60s who was recently widowed, and is selling the truck because it was her husband's and she doesn't need it any more. She was asking $11k, I offered $10k. She thought about it, said, ""well, I could probably get around $9k from a dealer, so that sounds pretty good.""Then she says something that's like crack cocaine for a car nut... ""you wouldn't happen to be interested in a little convertible, would you?"" ....-Jason "

The paint is phenomenal - not a scratch on the thing. The interior looks brand new. I couldn't resist - I took it for a spin and it was tight and surprisingly fast. Sweet little car, all the way around. I bring it back and ask, ""so how much are you looking for on this?"" She responds, ""oh, it's going really cheap. Kelly Blue Book says it's only worth about $2500"" Me - trying not to choke on my tongue - ""So, $12,500 for the pair?"" Her - ""Sure - you have a deal!""So now we have the (Mazda) MPV for family hauling, the (Mazda) pickup for everyday driving / work, the (Mazda) Miata for wringing out at the track, and the (Alfa) Spider for cruising, classic car shows, and tinkering in the garage...

Obviously, not as responsive as my 3-series (or as the X3), but it didn't feel trucklike, either, and the engine was incredibly smooth. It's hard to hit ""D"" on the gear selector, and the demo model had a rattle on the passenger side towards the end of the test drive... Arrrgh! I would feel okay about owning one of those out of warranty, though. The salesman also suggested I take a look at the new CR-V when they come out.

As far as it being so boring, I have thought for a while that if I were driving something that was lux enough (something like an LS430 or Q45), I'd be less interested in responsive handling and appreciate the soft, silent ride and really nice interior.

And the rattles? Again, nothing to complain about. I'm inclined to discredit that opinion because (1) they aren't car enthusiasts (translation: they Just Don't Get It), and (2) they are better known to the posters here as the mother-daughter team that recently purchased a yellow Taliban Edition VW Beetle. The one idea they did come up with that I can agree with is that I will not be happy with a car I consider to be too boring--but, I'm not convinced (as they are) that I would find anything other than a small, German sedan to be boring.

"woodyww","August 2006"," If you have an advanced bmw addiction, I'm not sure I'd take automotive advice from people who just bought a Taliban Edition VW Beetle. (Occasionally, non-car buffs can give good advice to a car nut in the midst of an obsession, but it sounds like these 2 have their own car-nuttiness going on).If--the bmw gives you more trouble, & hopefully it won't--you might be willing to trade off the nth degree of performance for some type of Japanese vehicle perhaps. Or sell it, & buy a CRV, + an older 3 or 5 series for $5K or $10K for the summers.A lot of the most crazed bmw addicts own older ones, & just deal with repairs, but then you really need a good indie bmw mechanic nearby, as the dealer service is so expensive.....

"nippononly","August 2006"," my '88 RX-7, and my '82 Supra.

None. The Supra was a tired old car with 200K on the clock, but I had it for years and had it set up just the way I liked it. It only had 146 hp in '82 but had a wonderfully smooth straight 6 that pulled like a racehorse. Not to mention it was still running strong....I finally sold it when I got my '97 Subaru Outback Sport - now that I have mostly gotten trucks out of my system, I wish I had kept that OBS too. "

It didn't hold a candle to the more expensive German cars, but the Jetta was more responsive and had more road feel than most of the other (Japanese and American) small cars of its day, and the VR6 was the smoothest of the engine choices, and lacked the turbo lag that was a defining characteristic of the 1.8T.

"qbrozen","August 2006"," sounds real similar to mine (although a 5 vs 7) ... just 10 years earlier. $1k bought it with a carburetor that needed rebuilding. A $15 rebuild kit later and it was pretty darned reliable. The 258 I6 with the 3-speed stick and 32 (or 33, i forget)x10.5 on 15"" chrome wagon wheels. Oh, you would have liked this ... no back seat or radio, so my mom (good ole mom) built me a custom box for the rear that had a padded top for seating and room to mount two 6x9s, a pioneer tape deck, and 200-watt amp inside. screwed it down right between the wheelwells. Pretty much theftproof unless you happened to be a thief with a sharp hatchet on hand. Pop is a mad scientist, so he pulled the power brake booster and power steering out of a '75 cherokee and adapted them to the CJ. Oh, and let's not forget the power leather seats from an old junkyard Tbird. Made it the most comfortable cruising CJ you'd ever want to meet. I could steer it with one finger and stop on a dime.

The windshield assembly (new frame, wiper assembly, glass, and chrome lightbar) is still in my parents barn. Been there for about 15 years now. I told the buyer $1500 and why it was that much.

"graphicguy","August 2006"," Being a charter member of CCBA, there's more than a couple of 'em I miss. Let's start with the latest....'04 RX8. As nipponoly said, the thing guzzled gas and I kept a few qrts of oil in the trunk. But, zinging that car to it's 9K redline, as well as probably being the finest handling and balanced car I've ever driven. That made it one of my all-time faves, and I miss it. It had an unfortunate incident with an F-150. I survived. The car gave it's life for me, though.Going back to some of the used cars (some, very used) I miss.....'69 MGB GT. Wasn't particularly powerful. It wasn't fast. But, it was fun. The females ""dug"" it. And, I learned all about auto mechanics and maintenance on it (by force), trying to keep it on the road.Another one I miss was a well used '76 Datsun 260Z. It was probably the poorest model for a Z car, but it introduced me to what a smooth running straight 6 engine really could do. It was a rust bucket by the time I got my hands on it, but again, the girls loved it (ex girlfriend ended up totalling it...at which time, we promptly broke up).The all time ""missed"" car was a '67 GTO convertible with an HO 400 motor. Bought it while it was in storage. An old guy who lived in my parents neighborhood had bought it new for his wife's 60th birthday. Unfortunately, he didn't ask her if she wanted a manual tranny (which she didn't). She disliked it so much, he pulled it into the garage and let it sit (except for his occasional drives to keep the battery charged and dry rot away from the rubber parts). That went on for 20 years ('87) until he started ""liquidating"" assets in his twilight years (he actually died less than a year after I bought it from him).While, I had long since moved away from my parents neighborhood, The GTO owner remembered me as a young'un drooling over that garaged GTO. He'd actually let me sit in it if I were passing by and he had it out for a drive (well before I was able to reach the peddals).He contacted my father when he was about to sell his house to move into a retirement home and asked if he thought I'd be interested in buying the GTO. My father contacted me. Asked my father to give the guy $500 to hold it for me (which he did, grudgingly). I was living out of town, but ended up at the guy's house the following weekend. Bought it on the spot without even starting it up. It was completely stock. He made me a very fair deal since old muscle cars weren't exactly on the forefront of anyone's mind during that period of time, and I was a neighbor ""kid"".Pushed it 5 houses down to my parents home. Changed the oil. Put new valve cover gaskets on it....new hoses and belts. Flushed and filled the radiator. Did a brake job. Tuned it. Checked the compression. All was good. Did all this in my parents driveway over the course of a Saturday and Sunday. (much to my mother's chagrin). Drove it home. Surprisingly, it had no rust. It did need paint and a new top. I put new tires on it, painted it (original gold color), put a new top on it....and battery. Interior was in great shape. No cracks or rips. Just needed to get a thorough cleaning and detailing. Everything worked (including the factory A/C and FM radio option).Boy did I love that car. But, in the ensuing years, I got married. Wife made me sell it to get a ""proper family sedan"". Idiot that I was, I complied. Wife is now gone and I miss the GTO more than I ever did her. "

"graphicguy","August 2006"," tifighter....yeah, if I knew then what I know now. The '60s era GTO, back in the '80s, wasn't nearly as coveted as it is today. The Big 3 back in the '80s were really putting out some garbage...putting stripes on their cars and calling them ""sports cars"". Nothing could have been further from the truth.I did make some good money on that GTO when I sold it, but nothing compared to what it would have brought in today's market...particularly given that I kept it in tip-top shape. For all intents and purposes, it was my daily driver. I did all the work on it myself (when you could actually maintain a car with simple tools and a little knuckle grease and know-how). I was living in a ""no snow"" area back then, though.'60s muscle cars were nowhere to be found on the road back in the '80s. There was nothing on the street back then that the GTO couldn't quickly dispatch....not from the big 3 (not even a 'vette), not from Toyota (Supras)...Honda (Preludes), nor Datsun (Z cars). There was one gas station I found that sold racing fuel. The GTO took leaded gas, so that's the only place I went to get the ""go juice"" the car thirsted for. I felt like a ""made guy"" when I drove that car on the street....especially with the top down.To add insult to injury, I ended up taking the money I got for that GTO and buying.....get this.....a new Chevy Citation (the ex-wife thought it was ""cute""). Talk about a piece of garbage. This was in the era of 12 mo/12K warranties. As soon as the warranty was up, it literally began to fall apart. At 30K miles (a little over 2 years later), the engine sounded like a John Deere diesel. Door handles wouldn't stay on the doors. It spewed various fluids like it had a terminal disease. It looked (and drove) like it had 250K miles on it.The GTO was built like a tank, in comparison.I often wonder where that GTO is now. "

I thought, ""Oh, somebody traded in a Miata."" I took a second look and thought, ""Holy :surprise:, it's an S2000! What the frell is that doing here?"" I stopped by on my way home that afternoon and took it out for a spin. One of the nice things about rural living is the maze of twisty back roads marked at 55 mph. I went back Tuesday morning to do the deal, and took it home that afternoon just ahead of a series of dumping thunderstorms.

Jag just needs time to get their product line fixed a little bit and Land Rover needs to get some of Jag's quality to slide over. That should start happneing very quickly now as the newest Land Rover is going to be built and Jag's Halewood plant. "

"bumpy","August 2006"," I haven't driven it enough to gauge the mpg, but the EPA rating was 20/26 stock. Mine has a CAI (and a really evil resonance between 3 and 4000 rpm) and what I suspect is a 4.77 or 4.875 rear gear (stock is a 4.1), so I doubt I'll ever see much above 20.The S2000 radio controls are on the dash to the left of the steering wheel. The only thing on the wheel are two of the three cruise control buttons. The JVC seems to work well enough, but the S2000 isn't the kind of car that really needs a radio. "

The oversized ghetto cruiser rims will kill the Kappas in the corners, and the lower redline will also slow them down. :sick: It's like bringing a breech-loader up against a repeating rifle. "
"rayainsw","August 2006"," I drove 2 Coupes, back to back. 1 = MX0, 3LT, NAV (Std. \ base suspension) & 1 = MX0, 1LT, Z51.Brief background. I have driven 4 door sport sedans for many years. Last Corvette I drove was a &#146;98 or &#146;99 C5 owned by a business associate about 5 years ago. Last one I have been inside, except at a show or (stationary) at a dealer, was a Y2K C5. My current ride is a 2005 GP GXP (5.3L V8, 4 speed manumatic w/Paddles), with published quarter times generally clustered in the low 14s.Paddle Shift A6. One of the reasons I have waited until now to allow myself to seriously consider a Corvette has been the previous 4 speed automatic trans. No offense intended to anyone with that trans., but each of my past 4 sedans has had a 4 or 5 speed manumatic trans. &#150; and I know I would miss that feature, a lot. ( I have posted several reasons for my preference elsewhere on the Forum. ) This 6 speed trans. with paddle shift manumatic function is an acceptable implementation. Shift response to paddle command could certainly be quicker, but I am reasonably certain now that I could adapt. Otherwise, the driveline is smooth and refined. Engine response is always sharp & immediate. LS2 = great V8!Z51. Not as much ride difference as I&#146;d expected, but expecting to put 15K mi / yr on what will be a daily driver ( unlikely to be driven on a track or auto-X ), cheaper & longer lasting front tires, etc. mean I&#146;d be fine with the Base suspension. I did not stress the car, handling-wise, in my drives, and thus would not have been able to evaluate any difference(s) in ultimate limits. I trust the published numbers &#150; as I believe the Quarter Mile ET-s I&#146;ve seen.The ride of the base suspension suits me & my driving requirements just fine. The ride is certainly firm, but I found it well controlled \ damped & I expect that it will be livable for my long trips as well as my commute. Also (and one reason I did not fight the suggestion that I drive a Z51 as well as a Base car) neither of these 2 cars showed any signs of extraneous noise, such as creaks or groans or squeaks from interior plastic bits rubbing or from anything that might not be bolted (screwed, glued) together perfectly. I noticed no wind noise at the (brief) 70 MPH cruise intervals. ( Sound systems were off during all of both drives. ) I presume that it would be the same at any speed I&#146;d be comfortable holding & cruising = typically 80 MPH or so. No vibrations noted at any speeds &#150; in either car. I heard no &#145;click&#146; on brake applications. The overall impression was of a very well engineered & carefully assembled car. Remarkably so. Kudos, GM.Sport seats = excellent comfort & support! 1LT \ base seats, not so much.The controls and displays are well done & I felt immediately comfortable in the car &#150; and given that the driving position is a good 6 or 7 inches (or more) lower than anything I have driven in a long time, that really impressed me.Acceleration. Well, &#145;acceptable&#146; hardly covers this. ( New cars, low miles, no abuse.) But there is definitely enough acceleration ability to appreciate the difference between my current sedan (again, low 14s) and a 13 flat or better sports car.Sound. I will probably replace the exhaust at some point, with something just a bit more aggressive &#150; but the combination \ blend of engine & exhaust was OK. For now. Handling. I certainly did not stress these cars. They both felt sure footed, planted, confidence inspiring. I expect that it will be rewarding to drive at 6 or 7 tenths, without being punishing to drive over imperfect surfaces. Steering. See above. And: Effort, response, road feel, & kickback = all excellent on the 5 mile (or so) loop I drove.Outward visibility. OK. Rear mirror size & placement, etc. is not quite as good as I had hoped (and I am used to) but I think it will be OK. The only remaining issue \ concern for me here is the low roof line & ability to see things like overhead traffic signals. Best I can tell, I &#145;lose&#146; about 6 to 8 inches of windshield height, compared to what I am used to seeing, looking forward. My &#145;Solution&#146; = I will order the CC3.HUD = very cool. Even better than mine. I have one in my GXP, and use it literally all the time. This particular example had a slight ( but would be annoying ) distortion, likely in the windshield glass at that particular area &#150; as I moved my head side to side while driving. ( Not caused by polarized sunglasses. ) But the Tachometer display as well as the gear selected & the MPH means I would even more rarely have to look down at the instruments. Well done.3LT. 1LT. I already knew that I would want the 3LT. As stated, I found the sport seats (2LT & 3) to be exceptionally comfortable as well as supportive. (I am 6&#146;0&#148; and approx. 225 \ 230 #s.) The 1LT \ Base seats, were noticeably less comfortable, at least for me. I&#146;d also find the lack of the current trans. gear display on the HUD (3LT) to be annoying in a 1LT or 2LT &#150; having to divert my eyes well down off the road, to the DIC display, below the Speedo & Tach. And the telescoping wheel allows me to adopt a more comfortable driving position.I will once more mention that I noted ( and thoroughly enjoyed ) the very significant difference in acceleration feel between my current sedan (again, documented as a low 14s) and this 13 flat (or better) C6 A6. Because this is one primary reason for my lusting after the C6, and these drives met my (high) expectations. In my street driving, I can rarely even approach the handling limits of any car, as I always want to leave some measure of safety margin, to allow for the unexpected (for example: sand or oil on the road surface, an idiot move by another driver, etc.) even in (um) &#145;spirited&#146; cornering. But I can ** ALWAYS ** manage a safe place to use WOT. Even if only briefly.Yet, quite clearly, the C6 is much more than a very quick accelerating sports car. There was certainly no doubt in my mind after these test drives that the C6 is a thoroughbred: A refined, but very capable grand touring machine - as well as a an outstanding overall sports car. Exactly what I am looking for, right now.So. I will likely order a 2007 &#150; for delivery in late September to late October. ( Assuming that I can come to terms with a dealer on Price. )MX0, 3LT, CC3, Monterey Red \ Titanium.And yet, I was invited to drive the new BMW 335i Coupe here near Atlanta this weekend. And I am going to do that as well . . .Clearly afflicted . . .Comments welcome.- RayVery favorably impressed with the &#145;Vette. "

"andre1969","August 2006"," And the bills for upkeep of a fleet that large would be chasing me all over the place.I think that's probably the thing that keeps me from amassing too much of a junkyard. If I add another car to my regular insurance policy, it's about $300 per year for liability-only. If I put a car on my antique policy it only comes out to something like $6.00 per $1000 of stated value. But then the car has to be kept in a locked garage. I estimate that my 4-car garage ended up costing about $28,000 so far (still has to be painted, needs gutters, needs the electric hooked up, etc), so that comes out to about $7,000 per car, plus whatever it does to my property taxes the next time I get assessed. On the plus side, I guess it does add value to the property, but I'm sure there's a diminishing rate of returns on stuff like that. While having the one garage might raise the value by X amount, building a second one might not add any value!One of my neighbors had two houses on about 5 1/2 acres of land. The older house up front had a separate 2-car garage. The newer house in back had a 4 car detached garage, as well as an oversized 2-car carport. It was something like 27-28 feet deep, so if you pulled the lead cars up far enough, you could get a couple cars in behind them, enough to at least get the passenger compartment out of te weather. And on top of that he built another building, kind of a raised carport with a peaked roof that was big enough to hold a motorhome and two cars. There had been another building on the lot too, big enough to hold a car. However, the place got sold back in 2001, and the new owner tore down the motorhome carport and the single-car garage. I wish I had the money to buy the place back then. The whole thing, 5.5 acres, two houses and all only sold for something like $270K, but at the time it may have been a $billion, because I couldn't afford it either way. And nowadays, we have half-acre lots with nothing on them asking $330K and more, so I'd hate to think what this property would go for these days. At one time the guy must've had something like 20 or more old cars and trucks scattered around back there. His property was surrounded mostly by woods, so he could get away with it for awhile. Until a new development went in a few hundred feet behind him, and the first winter, once the leaves were off the trees, somebody complained about a school bus he had back there! :surprise: A lot of his stuff really was junk though, and probably just got hauled off to the dump/junkyard.Maintenance can be annoying, too. You'll get the feeling that you just changed the oil, replaced the battery, did a tuneup, etc, because chances are that you just did! It's just now it's time to do it with another car! "

"andre1969","August 2006"," How hard is it to get a replacement title on a vehicle? I'm sure it varies by locality, but when my buddy traded his '98 Tracker for an '06 Xterra back in May, he couldn't find the title. He had the title that still showed a lien on it. And he had a payoff notice from GMAC, but no title that showed the lien released. He went to the DMV (well in MD they call it MVA) and they took care of it right then and there.Having the original title and the payoff notice might have helped, though. Which reminds me, I better look around and see if I actually have a clear title on my Intrepid, or just the original title and a payoff notice. I've been saying that I don't want to buy another car until the summer of '08, when my driving record is squeaky-clean again, but I'm kinda pissed at my Intrepid right now.I went out to change the oil and the pcv valve. Oil was no trouble, but with the pcv valve, the little rubber hose that connects into it had rotted and literally fell apart when I was trying to wrestle it off. I found some old heater hose in my grandparents' garage and was able to rig something up so that it at least seems to run okay. The check engine light doesn't come on or anything.I know it's kinda dumb to get bent out of shape over a little piece of hose that's probably under 10 bucks at the dealer.

I'm not certain of this, but I believe the map updates cost $$$. Firmware/software is free, though.You can have the NUVI give you alternate routes, too....if you run into traffic jams. It does not have ""real time"" traffic updates (at least my 350 doesn't), however.Very easy to use. Text to speech is very understandable and the screen is very bright.woody....I'll admit I'm a tech geke, but the GPS systems that are integrated into the car these days are very good. Mine offers speech recognition (most 3rd party units do not). So, I can just bark out an address and the unit will find what I'm looking for. Mine also controls my blue tooth cell phone. All names and numbers are downloaded from my phone. All I have to do is say ""call home"" and the number is automatically dialed and the conversation is handled via the microphones and speakers in the car. It's great since you don't have to take your eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel to control anything regarding the GPS or your cell phone. "

One question though, do the aftermarket units like the Garmin list hotels, restaurants, and their phone #'s?growwise: The TSX is smaller, has a firmer suspension, and has a higher performance engine than the 4 cylinder Accord. The V6 Accord is faster than the TSX however. The TSX has more luxury features like memory seats, HIDS, better stereo, and in my opinion better interior materials. The Acura has a better warranty and roadside assistance but is more expensive than the 4 cylinder Accord and probably more expensive than a V6 Accord considering the deals on Accords right now. As for the noise level the TSX is much quieter than our 04 Accord EX-L. It's a tough call between the Accord and the TSX. It just depends where your priorities are. "

Often found in subdivisions where most of the houses look almost exactly alike. A house with a McMansion floorplan generally looks much better (and I might not call it a McMansion) when it's sitting in the middle of a field on a small farm rather than on the smallest suburban lot possible. Large houses with small yards are convenient for maintenance purposes but they're often squeezed so close together that the sense of proportion is way out of whack.Linguistically, the ""Mc"" comes from McDonald's, and is used as a derogatory modifier to signify the commoditization and devaluation of what was once a unique item.

He buys a Mercedes ML, Chrysler Pacifica clone to add to his stable.His wife has traded him in for a newer, more energetic model. He's been living in an ""extended stay"" hotel type place and is seriously considering bankruptcy. Not his fault, per se. Come to find out, neither he, nor his soon to be ex, can afford the cars or the house. It's a mess.We're pretty much middle class around here. Some want to pretend we're not, but we are. 3,500 sq ft homes on 3/4 acre...some with inground pools. New development when I had my home built 14 years ago. Prices ranged from $225K-$290K, at the time. Probably range from $325K-$400K now.Put these same homes anywhere in CA, and you're looking at $1.5M-$2M.

"andre1969","August 2006"," I pretty much use the term to describe a house that's oversized for its lot and neighborhood, and is overly flashy or imposing looking. This neighborhood that went in on the filled in swamp and farm up the street has houses that start at around 2500 square feet, but easily top 4000. And they just seem over-styled, with their brick, stone, and stucco facades, columns, extra eaves and arches in the roofs, etc. And speaking of roofs, the roofs just seem too over-sized for the house, kind of puffing it up and making it look bigger and more impressive than it really is.In some ways they kind of make me think of the false fronts that they used to build on structures in the old west, to try and make them look bigger, more impressive, and ""big-city"" like than they really were.To put it in perspective with the rest of the neighborhood, most of the houses on my street range from 1000-2000 square feet. Before that community went in, the two biggest houses were old farmhouses built in the late 1800's. One's about 2600 square feet, but it sits on 7 acres. The other's about 2800-2900 square feet, and it sits on 2 acres. Neither one is particularly tall or imposing, and they have tall, mature trees growing up around them to tone down their presence a bit so the houses kind of blend in with their lots rather than overpower them.Nowadays, in my area at least, it seems like all new single family homes are ""McMansions"". Land is too expensive for them to use it on the lowly rambler, split level, split foyer, or even on more sprawling one-story designs that have a large footprint. So anything single-family is usually a mammoth two-story affair these days. The smaller single family homes have prety much been replaced by townhouses and condos.In my area, the starting price for a McMansion is usually in the $600K range. But even a typical new townhouse will put you out for about $400K.I remember when the McMansion orchard up the street went in. The base models started at $264K. The model home, as it was equipped, 4000+ square feet with two staircases and big enough to get lost in for a few minutes at least, would have gone for about $500K back then. I doubt if any of them are on more than a 10,000 square foot lot. Nowadays, even a half-acre building lot would set you back $300K or more, and they have zoning regs in place to prevent you from building a house on less than 1/2 acre. The only way that development massed muster with its sub 1/4 acre lots was because they got the county to factor the drainage pond and the park across the street and even part of the road's right of way into the total, and then just divided all that by the number of houses they built.If my family hadn't been in this area for ages, before the prices shot up, I wouldn't be able to afford to live here!

Lookout / Hyde Park with the city schools.I still say that 90% of the time I hear ""McMansions"" used, it is done with a tinge of envy.Getting back to cars, there is not a week that I don't get a call from my brother in Cincinnati telling me about a co-worker massively upside down and in trouble with a car loan.

Did the Ciera still have the nice, plush interior by that time or did they find ways to cheapen it? That's one thing I liked about some of those Cieras and A-body Centurys...they just seemed more plush inside than the W-bodies that followed.I think if it were me I'd be tempted to just drive the Ciera until it was totally dead, even though at those prices, the used Impala wouldn't really put you out too much.

"andre1969","August 2006"," Personally, I could live in a house that is based on a 5-6 car garage with living space upstairs, but it would be hard to make it ""fit in"" with any nearby homes. If the county had let me build the garage I originally wanted to build, it would've been big enough to live in. Originally I was going to do a 30x40 garage with a second story, and a gambrel barn roof. The county shot me down because it was over the height restriction (at the time, 15 feet for any secondary buildings) and bigger than the house. The house is really about 1500 square feet, but the dept of assessments has it down at 1106. They consider it a 1 1/2 story even though the upstairs dormers make about 90% of the upstairs full-height. So they wouldn't let me go over 1106 square feet for the garage. For some reason they didn't count the garage loft as square footage.So, I went back and had the company design a 24x40 garage, standard roof. When I went back down to the county office to get the permit, they told me they changed the ruling on heights for secondary buildings. It was now 20 feet. They took that measurement at the ""midpoint"", which was half way up the side of the roof on cape cods, or where the flatter plane and the steeper plane joined on gambrel style buildings. I dunno where they'd take the measurement on a ""real"" 2-story building though. But by that time I was fed up and didn't want to have the company draw up a THIRD building! :mad: I'm thinking about building a carport addition on the back of it though, maybe 12x40 or 15x40, or somewhere in between. That would give me enough room to get two more cars out of the brunt of the weather. "

Speaking of deals, seems like you can get a base Mercury Milan for $16K and change these days, and get 72-month 0% financing into the bargain. It's a pretty well-equipped car for that price tag. I'd take that over the new Sonata - drove one of those, didn't seem to match all the hype. "

Ford is now warranting all powertrains for five years too, so you will be under warranty the entire time for the expensive important stuff. "

They make an X-Runner you might like, coming out of the BMW and all. Has a pretty good handling package (for a truck) that includes quicker steering and transforms the Tacoma. Not especially fast though - just 240ish hp in a moderately heavy vehicle (I forget woody, is yours a 325i or a 330i? The X-Runner could probably keep up with a 325 despite its weight). Also has the same 6-speed shifter as the rest of the V-6 Tacomas, so you would want to trade that out maybe, although the feel of it is pretty good. Geez, maybe I should trade MY truck for an X-Runner - I'm talking myself into one here! :-P "

The reason is that if you suddenly let your foot off the gas, NOx emissions go way up just for a second, and they want to get emissions down to meet current standards. Try driving a Chevy Cobalt some time - that one stands out among the many models I have driven in recent times as having that problem really badly. I have driven the V-6 Tacoma with the stick, and it is not as bad as others I have sampled. Now as for the curtain airbag package thing, you have me flummoxed there.

But I don't: my 5-series is in near mint condition, & has had only a couple of minor things go wrong in 6 years (knock wood!).The only way I can rationalize buying a new Tacoma, sort of, is if: I keep the BMW. (Then you can get into, if I want a 2nd vehicle, why buy a P/U, if I already have a wagon? And If I just want a Snow Car, I could get a 10 y.o. Subaru for $5K). The only thing I can say is, I like the way the Tacomas look. And I could make it my Winter vehicle, with 4wd & the right tires. If the resale value is as good as people say, hopefully I could sell it & not lose too much if it doesn't work out. And I need a ""truck fix"", for whatever reasons.......maybe if I can get a great deal from my local toyota dealer, it wouldn't be my worst automotive purchase..... "
"nippononly","August 2006"," Yeah, X-Runners are RWD only. They are lowered and have special suspension, extra X-bracing (hence the model name) under the bed for less body flex, limited-slip rear diff, and larger rims and tires (I believe with the new model they are summer tires). Best options for resale: auto and 4WD. Both will get you a good return, 4WD especially in the Tacoma. You have to get the SR5 package IMO - it has the stuff I like including cruise, improved stereo depending on the package, privacy glass and rear slider, and leather on the shifter and steering wheel. But it won't get you a whole lot in resale - might make the truck easier to sell though. There are several different TRD packages - the sport ones include the X-Runner's suspension components but are not lowered and don't have its rims or seats, or the visual stuff (except some have the hood scoop - I agree, that's silly. I wouldn't want it). They won't get you a whole lot in resale either, I wouldn't think. The off-road ones include locking diff, better suspension and tires, and a few things like that (lots of appearance stuff, in typical Toyota fashion). Skid plates come with those packages too. Not a whole lot of resale value there, but probably more than the TRD sport packages, and they make the truck decidedly more attractive to a buyer who will actually use it offroad. "
"nippononly","August 2006"," The only Toyotas holding their value better than Tacomas right now are Prius and Lexus. Tacoma has excellent resale. But the V-6 auto 4x4 XtraCab with TRD offroad package you are contemplating is going to get close to a $30K sticker, especially if you manage to find one with the VSC and you still want that. It's a lot of green, and it will pull maybe 18 mpg in normal use. I have been looking at Tacomas pretty seriously recently....I have been looking at 4-cyl 4WDs though, which are a rare breed at Toyota dealerships... "
"corvette","August 2006"," If you really like the Tacoma, there's nothing wrong with having that plus a station wagon. And, if you get something you want, versus just a snow car, you'd probably drive it occasionally just for a change of scenery. But, it sounds like a loaded one may cost nearly as much as an RDX, and you'll have to roll your own nav system. "

Even if the dash is kinda Battlestar Galactica, I like the driving position better. For the Corolla, it seems to me like you almost have to be built like an ape to fit comfortably, with short legs and long arms. When I put the seat back all the way, my legs are still cramped, but the steering wheel is a bit of a reach. If they made the seat go back any further, I wouldn't be able to reach the steering wheel at all! Now my uncle has an '03 Corolla, but to be honest, he IS built kinda like an ape! He has short legs, a long torso, and fairly long arms.That's my biggest complaint about the Corolla...the driving position. Oh, and the $1500 catalytic converter. :mad: And to a lesser degree, the egg-shape. "

"woodyww","August 2006"," I wonder why--Tacomas have better resale than 4Runners, for instance? Or RAV 4's? I guess it's just because it's a P/U.To say I don't ""need"" the TRD package is probably an understatement. I guess I need to figure out the cost of one of the TRD packages vs. one of the SR5 packages. Figuring out option ""packages"" on Toyotas I find very frustrating. To be honest, will I really buy one? I might--I need to see what my local Toyota dealers are doing on Tacomas. Right now it's my current automotive fantasy (I can't afford a new Porsche).Would you get the 4x4 XtraCab 4cyl?

My truck would never be really loaded down, want it mainly for some offroading and ski trips and the like, as well as very light hauling duties.TRD packages are in the neighborhood of $1000-1500 more than the SR5 packages, and of course you don't need to get both - the TRD packages include all the stuff in the SR5 packages. 4Runners have always had VERY good resale as well, until the big anti-SUV market backlash that's been going on since the gas prices spiked. Since then, 4Runner resale has taken it right on the nose. RAV4s are car-based, so their resale has never been as hot, but it's still pretty solid. One of the better Toyotas in that regard. It seems like Toyota doesn't build any 4-cyl 4x4 Tacomas with the expensive packages (is this a blessing or a curse? I'm not sure. :-P). SR5 is about it, which would probably be fine for me. I like the look of the TRD offroad package, knobbier tires and all, but get that with the V-6 and you're at $28-29K sticker before you know what happened. :-(That's a lot for a vehicle that will get 18 to the gallon and be more expensive to insure.

"woodyww","August 2006"," Very, very good points. I can't argue the 4 cyl. vs. 6, if only because ""everyone wants what they want"". But, it is a truck, it's not the tiny Toyota P/U of 15-20 years ago, & if there are way more 6 cyl's available, you might be likely to get a much better deal on one (?).I looked at the TRD package again, & for what you get, over the SR5: Alloys, fog lights, Bilsteins, nicer seat fabric (?), etc., it seems like a very good deal. One thing I learned when I bought my current bmw: it's way more expensive to add options after the fact (if you really want them). And it's frustrating to drive around in a car you got ""a better deal on"", but wish you'd spent the extra $3K on the BMW Sport Package, or whatever. Personally, I think I'm going to look at used 4Runners, esp. if the prices are down. And maybe slightly used current-gen Tacomas--even tho everyone says their resale is so good that it's almost not worth buying used, if I could get a mint condition year old TRD package & save a few thousand (?), that could make it do-able for me.I guess $28K sticker for a TRD offroad package, auto, V6, doesn't seem ridiculous to me. And the 18 mpg: well, I owned a Ranger Rover that got 12 mpg, so......But it's all Personal decisions & preferences, I think. Cheers, Woody "

That has me doing double-takes, but I agree it is not an outlandish price in the context of the market. The big V-6 the current model has makes this truck FAST when it's empty. It weighs about what my 4Runner does but has a full 1/3 more power. Wow.As for 4Runners, new ones are being so heavily discounted now that paying more than about $22K for a used 4x4 Runner is a bad idea, IMO.

Too hard to find, so I stopped trying!As for 4-cyl extended cabs, it is easy to find Tacomas in that configuration as long as you only want RWD. If you want 4WD, there are like a handful anywhere on the west coast. Funny thing is, this weekend I was camped next to some people that had one (4-cyl 4WD). They told me it took them forever to get the one they wanted, and even then they had to settle for the ubiquitous silver, when they really wanted the dark blue. As for the diesels, Toyota sells more diesel than gas in Hilux (Tacoma/4Runner) in some global markets. I think they just didn't bring it here because they never saw the demand, and because of the new emissions regs. Since they have announced there will be a diesel for the next-gen Tundra, I think it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility that they might eventually certify a diesel for the Tacoma too. That would be a good idea, I think. Why don't any of the manufacturers offer a diesel in their midsize pick-ups? "

The hood wouldn't come open, so they ended up prying it open with a crowbar. Once I get a rental car tomorrow I will probably go out to the tow yard to try to get better pictures of the underhood area. There are a lot of non-obvious things that could be damaged, like the run-flat tires.

FWIW, when my uncle's '03 Corolla got hit by a deer, it tore it up a lot worse than that! That hit actually jammed his door shut, and he had to get in and out on the passenger side!I'm surprised that the hit tore out the leaf spring on that Cherokee. I wonder if it was somewhat weak and ready to break, anyway. That might also be what caused that that rusty lookins smear on the BMW. Either that or the tire. It's weird, but sometimes I've seen tires leave brown marks...and not just after going off-roading in the cow pasture!Anyway, good luck. Hope your ordeal with the insurance company and body shop is painless! "

No airbags deployed. My head, neck, and back hurt, and I can't sleep, but I guess I'll try to go to class tomorrow (took today off).I called BMW North America, and they said the closest body shop they have certified is Voss Village in Centerville (135 miles away). If nothing changes, I'm having it sent to a recommended local shop for an estimate tomorrow and then I'll probably press the insurance company to handle it from there. "

"british_rover","September 2006"," Hmhh something was wrong with the jeep to begin with or they were going a lot faster then 10 mph.

The first time I got hit at nearly 45 mph and although it did bend the door in pop the axle out of place the car was just fine after repairs. I think the repairs ended up being about 5,500 dollars.The second time I wrecked it I flipped it into 3 trees upside down at 50 mph. I slamed into the trees upside down and eight feet in the air. The roof only colapsed about 2 inches after landing on the ground and the engine was still runnign while upside down. The hood was barely buckled and the fenders were also barely buckled.That second wreck did the vehicle in though as it had 145,000 miles on the clock by then and there was too much damage. "

"corvette","September 2006"," I have an independent mechanic that I use to switch out the snow tires (found him through the CCA), and he recommended two shops in the area. On the other hand, it's better to let the insurance company call the shots if you want to be able to complain about it later. :sick: The tires on the Cherokee looked like they had plenty of tread on them in person. I took those photos with my camera phone, which is kind of blurry (it also made my headlight reflector look like a rust spot...) If there is really $12-15k in damage, I'm thinking I take the check and sell the wreck to a rebuilder. The front wheels look straight, though, so I'm not sure there's much structural damage. Safeco (his insurer) basically said it will take a long time before they admit liability. If/when they do that, they will pay for a rental, probably retroactively, but as long as I might be on the hook for it, I'm not keeping it. I can borrow one of Mom and Dad's cars in the meantime--they can temrporarily get by with one vehicle plus Dad's motorcycle. "

Fortunately, I had another vehicle I could use and could wait them out. During the waiting period, they kept hounding me to sign a medical waiver (which I didn't do). When all was said and done, I waited until the ""totalled"" my car out and they sent me a check before I signed anything. "

I waited 4 months on a ""waiting list"" to get the M6 into the best body shop in my area, then 6 months to be fixed (it took 2 months to get a bumper from Germany, etc.).It's weird--when I got home last night, & before reading about your accident, I looked at my car, & thought--a 6 y.o. bmw is as expensive a car as I want to own.

Your Xenon headlights & casings are probably $1500.

"corvette","September 2006"," RDX - very nice. No touch screen on the nav system, which is annoying, but it has voice recognition. Fast, smooth, and handles well. The transmission hesitates to kick down two gears. It has a huge console but the rear seat area is very spartan--just an armrest with cupholders and some cubbies in the doors. My impression is that there are no discounts right now. TL - I was less impressed with the TL. The interior and features are really nice, but I expected a larger difference in driving experience between a loaded Accord and a TL. It should be RWD. "
"woodyww","September 2006"," Very interesting. The thing turning me off about the RDX, is the price: $33K w/o NAV, &...... how much with NAV? Of course if you compare the price to an X3, the price seems much better.You've driven a loaded Accord? V6? You liked? Lately when I've seen current-gen Accords, I've thought, ""good looking car, I could live with that"". But I haven't driven one. Last time I test-drove a new Accord, in the late '90's (previous gen I think?), I was very un-impressed. But I was obsessed with expensive european cars then.It's hard to argue with buying an acura or honda tho. I'm thinking of looking at used MDX's myself (my Tacoma p/u phase has passed, for now).....

"graphicguy","September 2006"," Interesting comment about Acrua RDX. I like Acuras. But, a colleague just purchased a totally loaded, new Eddie Bauer Explorer. It's an '06, V8, leather, power 3rd row seats, 6 disk changer, sunroof....all the goodies. Took a ride in it. Ford did a very nice redesign on this vehicle.The kicker is, it stickered for nearly $40K. After rebates, he bought it for $32K and change. Have to say, at that price, it's a lot more bang for the buck than the RDX. OF course, I'm sure MPG isn't going to be as good as an RDX. Resale value won't be as good either. Still impressed with it, though. "
"corvette","September 2006"," I think the RDX was $37 and change with the nav system. Actually the last Accord I drove was a loaded four-banger. It was a little underpowered, but otherwise very nice.

"corvette","September 2006"," This may be heresy, but I think I prefer the RDX to the X3. Maybe the more powerful engine in the 2007 X3 would push me back in that direction--I've only driven a 2006 with the 3.0. "
"woodyww","September 2006"," Interesting, I was wondering what you thought about the RDX vs. X3. I guess one way to make the RDX look more affordable is to go price X3's :-).One nice thing about Acuras: there's usually only 1 or 2 option packages per model. Unlike bmw where there's such a vast array of separate options, & option packages, that it can be confusing, not to mention potentially very expensive.Some think the RDX is ""overpriced"", probably because of it's smallish size. But it's a ""Premium brand"", what are ya gonna do? A loaded RAV4 would be $$thousands less, but you can't even get Xenons for instance, which are standard on the RDX. And I'm guessing the RDX interior is a lot nicer, & that even the base stereo would blow away any Toyota (but not Lexus) stereo, etc....... "
"corvette","September 2006"," A RAV4 wouldn't have navigation, a rearview camera, or countless other features, and I can't imagine it would feel as balanced and agile as the RDX did. The RDX is also far ahead of the RAV4 on styling. The turbo four in the RDX is impressive. You can tell by the engine note that it's a four-cylinder, but it's very smooth, and they even included a boost gauge. The V6 in the TL felt less smooth than the Pilot that I drove! The Pilot was a 4WD model (without the active engine noise cancellation technology). If traffic is as backed up as it was earlier this afternoon, I don't think I'll make it to the Lexus dealer today.

"corvette","September 2006"," Basically, it is damaged enough that it will probably never be ""right."" I've made it clear to the insurance company that if they choose to repair the vehicle, I expect it to retain its pre-crash warranty, fit and finish, safety, quality, driving characteristics, and value. Now, that seems pretty impossible, but that is what they promised... My primary objective is making sure I'm not out $$$ as a result of the wreck. The looking for a replacement vehicle is an interesting and much-needed distraction from that.As far as getting another 325i, I have lived that dream, and enjoyed it, but I think I'd rather try something else next time. Mine had electrical problems from the day I took delivery, which were only recently corrected. "
"woodyww","September 2006"," I notice the RDX also has standard power Lumbar support. And according to the test in the Oct. R&T, a space-saver spare tire. Which I assume (?) means that it doesn't have Run Flats, so tire replacements won't cost $400 each, altho I'm sure the standard 18's aren't cheap.I've been getting more bummed with the Run Flat tires forced on us with current bmw's, & Mini's (my E39 has a full-size spare). What if you're driving late at night in the Boondocks, & get a flat? The Run-flats only have a limited range when flat, right? "
"corvette","September 2006"," What if you're driving late at night in the Boondocks, & get a flat?My plan has always been to fill it with Fix-a-flat to try to keep air pressure in it. If you haven't driven it with zero pressure, there's a chance of saving the tire (if you go to a tire shop--BMW dealers won't repair them). Those who have actually utilized the run-flat capability have reported that the actual range with no air pressure is longer than claimed. I would prefer standard tires with a spare until run-flat technology is a little better developed (i.e., the dealers are willing to repair them). "
"growwise","September 2006"," My car is in the shop and am contemplating on replacing it (still up in the air).

I also saw an 03 base stripper c240 with 26k km (17k miles) there for 22 gs cdn (they were 35 grand new for base but it looks bare and cant seat more than 2 at the back.

Part of me wants to stick it out for another 2 years but hey atleast I can get shopping started right.. "
"fintail","September 2006"," Personally, I would pass on both cars. If that 00 E430 is really that trashed (and your first pic does appear to be a 2000 car), it's probably been abused in other ways. MB people who care tend to do a very good job at taking care of their cars. It could be a money pit. Those W210s are known to rust, too...so if I was in your area I would inspect the undercarriage very closely. And the C-class...that model is known to have some issues, esp electrical, and a base one would be pretty spartan. Probably not a lot of fun.My belief with MB is get the best you can afford...the nicest one you can get will be more pleasurable than the cheapest, and a cheap Mercedes usually ends up being the most expensive. Be sure to look for maintenance records and physical signs the car has been cared for - good paint and interior.If you wait another couple years the cars will be that much cheaper, they are still depreciating. Or you could look for an older (94-00) C or W124 E - pristine examples of each are cheap now. "
"corvette","September 2006"," Whoa, we didn't get that stripper C240 model here in the states. I think all of our C-class models of the last generation had alloy wheels and painted door handles. I agree with fintail. You are going to have to be prepared to make repairs on any late-model MB, but these cars sound especially rough. "
"growwise","September 2006"," Thanks for the advice. Will keep looking. Shop just called and said that they need to keep my car for 4 more days as the part takes time to ship. That will be 1 week this thursday I'd be without a car.Anyways, how's volvo reliability these days? I think V70/XC70/V50 may suit my needs better (doggie and kid on the way; trips to airports etc) than a sedan. I think V50 is just too narrow and based on mazda3(yuck). I can just buy 2 mazda3 for one v50. V70 is nice but expensive. However, it has an available rear facing third row seat (not available in v50) which when not in use, a cargo barrier can be set up. This will prevent loose cargo or even (gasp) our dog from slamming into the second row seat on hard braking. Lots of quality but not sure about reliability. Throw passat wagon into this mix and things get interesting as it costs same as v50 I think? But VW and reliability are not synonymous according to what I gather. I am not that interested in Subes but a forester or legacy outback may serve the purpose too. Although an outback's rear seat is not that roomy. Oh well...One thing is for sure though.. I am more interested in Euro wagons than SUVs including the cute utes like CRV or RAV4. Minivan is just plain overkill and I am not going to be caught dead driving one :P "
"corvette","September 2006"," I'd take a Volvo over a VW, as far as reliability goes, but the VW would be more interesting to drive. I'm driving my mom's S80 right now, and it has had a handful of minor problems but no major ones. The most recent ones I can remember are the blackout tape on the front doors being wrinkled and the turn signal stalk sticking. Yesterday, I broke the plastic tilt/telescoping wheel adjustment lever. It wouldn't lock into place in the last inch or two of the wheel's travel, so I pushed the lever a little harder and *snap*. I was eventually able to lock the wheel into place even with the busted lever, though. This will be its first out-of-warranty repair, so we'll see how that goes. I like the S40/V50... Also, Subaru has an excellent history of reliability. "
"woodyww","September 2006"," As far as a used Mercedes, I'd agree with fintail. Personally, I'd feel a lot more comfortable with an older E-class--'88 thru '95 say, when they still had the Inline 6 cyl. I almost bought one of those in the wagon version a couple of times.A 2000+ bmw 5 series wagon (E-39) could be a good deal if you found a really nice one w/o high miles. They've depreciated greatly, & is usually considered one of the most reliable recent bmw models.Volvos--I'd probably want one with lots of warranty. Some owners seem to have very good luck, & others dump them because of too many problems. Another way to go (cheaply) would be to buy a, I dunno, 4-6 y.o. one & save so much on the purchase that you could afford to do any repairs & maintenence. My ex bought a 2 y.o. 850 & ran it up to well over 100K with only a radiator & A/C repairs, altho she spent a lot on scheduled maintenence. VW's--forget it, IMO. You might want to consider service convenience when buying a Euro. vehicle--closeness to a dealer, or top-notch indie mechanic..... "

"fintail","September 2006"," If you really want a MB, you should have a few things prepared....first, how much you want to spend. Then, how much you are comfortable on spending on maintenance (major services are pricey), it's a good idea to have a couple grand socked away for emergency repairs too. Then you'd need to commit to maintaining and caring for the car as it needs...you sound like someone who would do so anyway, but many do not...and although a MB can soldier on a long time without maintenance, they do eventually fail, and when they break, they break big. Knowing a good independent mechanic is very important too...I advise against taking an out of warranty MB to the stealership for repairs.I am glad to see someone wanting a wagon over a cute ute (I don't mind those sporty Volvos either) - esp seeing as the cute utes are just wagons for people who can't handle driving a ""wagon"" anyway. There are also some deals on older E and even C wagons out there, should you still want a MB. Every E wagon has been a pretty good design.

Not sure if it has ABS. Odometer clicked over 139K on the 25 mile drive home.Tested most of the features on the drive home:* A/C blows cold* Stereo and cruise work* Power windows work* Newer tires (185/70-14)* Oil was changed last October at 137K, according to the sticker in the window* Power locks work - sort of. Cannot lock drivers door with key. It just spins around in the keyhole.* One of the two tailpipes was amputated at the muffler, which results in a loud exhaust leak type of racket - kind of a ""fast 'n' furious"" type noise, except way more annoying* Dent in the right front quarter panel, right at the top of the wheel wellHope to get the title transferred today - it may require an emissions test, which would probably mean that the tailpipe will need to be repaired. One step at a time.Wife wanted to know how it drove. Well, it drove like a 14 year old car. If the tailpipe issue was fixed, not sure how quiet it would be and if it would make a good beater.Currently, we're thinking of doing as little as possible to it and sell it for $2000-2500.

"mrrk47","September 2006"," Hello, I just git a 2006 volvo s40 and am wondering what the real scoop is on Volvo reliabilty. I hear some people on here tell stories that span the spectrum from great to bad, that sounds alot like 98 percent of the brands out there. Is the average repair super expensive? The reputation that led me to Volvo was one of safety and reliability, this is evident by the big numbers of 15 to 20 year old Volvos on the road.  I imagine like any car if the scheduled maint. is done and the car is respected and taken care of there should'nt be too many huge problems. The only cars I can think of that seem to be bulletproof are hondas and lexus. some posts on here make it seem like each repair may cost 3000 grand each time, come on!  I understand that scheduled maint. can be pricey but I deem it worth it. My car with 3000 miles has had zero probs.  So, if any you guys can shed a little extra light on this for me and /or help comfort me that I didn't just fall into a money pit instead of a realy nice car. ...please do. "
"corvette","September 2006"," Well, you are covered by the factory warranty for 4 years or 50,000 miles. My mother has owned three Volvos over the past 17 years. The reliability of one went down at the five year mark and the other went down at the seven year mark. Both had about 85,000 miles on them at the time, and both were traded in on a new Volvo. Overall, repairs were more frequent and costly than a Japanese brand vehicle, but less frequent and costly than, say, a Volkswagen. The major problems on the European cars tend to be electrical. I've also seen interior/exterior trim issues on Mom's most recent Volvo, an S80. If you have a turbo engine, you need to use synthetic oil. You probably want to have the tires rotated at every 7,500 mile service, but it's not included on the factory service schedule. Those are the only things I can think of offhand. "
"sfcharlie","September 2006"," ""Throw passat wagon into this mix and things get interesting as it costs same as v50 I think? But VW and reliability are not synonymous according to what I gather.""I have a more temperate assessment of VW. I had a 1999 Passat for six years. It was the 4 cylinder turbo. I got the VW extended warranty for $1100 a year after I bought the car. My only repair gripe was frequency and cost of brakes and rotors while I was having car serviced at the dealer. After I found a local German auto repair shop, both frequency (of being told brakes and rotors had to be replaced) and cost of doing so (when really needed) went way down. No other chronic problems. Virtually all repairs, after meager 1999 24K warranty ran out, were taken care of (even at independent repair shop) by VW warranty (which took car out to 7 years and 100K miles).Also, think of CR and JD Powers ratings this way (using recent JDP report, on three-year reliability of 2004 cars, as an example): VWs averaged 3 problems per car over three years. MB averaged 2.5 per car. BMW averaged 2 per car. Would it really make a significant ownership experience difference to have made 2 trips for service, rather than three, over three years?Just one take on things. "
"tifighter","September 2006"," This discussion reminds me why I chose the Japanese route most recently. I have had 3 Audis and am most recently coming off a BMW, and it is a nice relief to not even think about this stuff anymore. Anytime a window was slow to go down, I'd think about sticking cash to it as it went in the door to see if that would prevent a failure. Or the Audi I had where the high beams would come on when I put on my right turn signal. That was funny. The constant climate control failures were not. Ask me sometime about the factory Audi tour I took in Ingolstadt where the nice tour guide explained the amount of beer consumption that was allowed on the assembly line ! :surprise: That said, if I were to go for a Mercedes, I'd look for the best W124 out there and cherish it for life. Especially a wagon. I think this was the last great Mercedes, and really good ones are getting harder to find. Only downside I see is that they are from the pre-side airbag era. A good E39 5er would be a decent car, but a lot of them are coming off of second or even third owners, which is where things get dicey. A E46 3 is a nice car, and there are some good ones out there; my FIL has a 00 323i that has been dead reliable and is still a really nice drive.And to be fair, Euro is not all bad. My Audi avant was rear ended by a Mazda once, and while the rear bumper cover had a gap from the tailgate and some scrathches, the front of the mazda was flat gone. As in it ceased to be.

"sfcharlie","September 2006"," My experience has been that some of the angriest owners are Japanese car buyers who either: (a) fail to notice that, while compiling lower repair rates, even Lexus cars are never reported by CR or JDP to be trouble free; and/or (2) imagine they are buying a magically perfect car because Toyota (recent recall was one of largest in automotive history) has figured out how to eliminate manufacturing defects; and/or (3) haven't heard about serious problems such as Toyota's many complaints about sludge collecting in oil pan (while that will be reported as one problem on CR or JDP survey -- while the German car window and headlight will count as two -- although it will threaten the owner with a ruined engine for which Toyota has historically failed to take responsibility). Take a quick look at vaunted Acura TL on CR. Notice that little black dot next to body integrity? It's a widespread rattle that the company cannot repair.When you buy a car because you assume you'll have no problems, there will be a big emotional price to pay if you do (and majority of owners will have some problem with a new car in the first three years, according to CR and JDP). The angriest owners I've known have been Japanese car owners who did have a dud, or, as you allude to, who were hurt in an accident and then noticed their car hadn't won any safety awards. In fact, of the 10 cars that won a Gold or Silver Safety Award from The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, only the Subaru Legacy and the Honda Civic were Japanese. The other 8 were European. Five of those 8 were made by VW-Audi company (3 Audi and 2 VW). If, instead of buying the car I most liked from among those I could afford, I was going to pick one from a statistical chart, I'd go with a safety award chart rather than a chart that is doing nothing other than trying to predict which car I'll be happy I bought after three years (when one real predictor right at hand is ""wow, I really I enjoy driving and being in this car!"").There is no salvation from the fact that cars are mass-produced machines with increasingly better, but imperfect, quality control. The one thing the buyer can control is not being pushed by CR or JDP statistics into buying a car that is not the one they most liked when they drove all the ones on their buying radar screen. "

Acura has quietly extended the warranty on just those transmissions out to 100,000 miles or so is what I remember him saying.You always have to take those reliablity surveys with a grain of salt as they all weight a blown engine the same as a faulty vanity mirror light. They are both just a reported problem. "
"jbollt","September 2006"," Toyota's many complaints about sludge collecting in oil pan (while that will be reported as one problem on CR or JDP survey -- while the German car window and headlight will count as two -- although it will threaten the owner with a ruined engine for which Toyota has historically failed to take responsibility. For what it's worth, I previously owned 2 of those Toyotas supposedly subject to sludge, (2) 2000 Camry 4 cyls. Toyota sent us a letter on both cars, giving us a much longer engine warranty, (I forget now how long of an extension exactly, but 100,000 miles seems to come to mind), only requiring proof of ONE oil change per year as proof of required maintenance. I would say that this does not indicate a manufacturer who: in your words, ""has historicaly failed to take responsibility"". With that said, I somewhat agree with your comment about the sludge counting as one item, and a window and headlight counting as 2. I believe that CR states that they weigh engine/driveline problems heaver than trim type items when giving the car an overall reliability rating. It does take careful evaluation of the statistics when using them to determine what they realy say.Taking into account that I have bought several Toyotas in the last several years, I buy cars that I enjoy driving. When younger, I prefered hard riding, great handling cars, didn't care how loud it was. Now, give me a quiet car, that doesn't punish me on the rougher roads, gets good mileage, good resale value, and reasonable reliability, and I have my perfect car. That's why I have bought mostly Toyoas recently. I keep testing Hondas when I am ready to buy, yet they are almost always noisier than the comparable Toyota model. Personal preference. I like the current VW lineup ALOT, but the problem posts here and other places, and the CR and JDP stats just won't let me take a chance. I value my time too much to be taking the car to the dealer (and having them tell me ""could not duplicate"" because the problem is intermittent)I might appreciate a little better handling (perhaps just a notch fimer shocks) on my Camry Hybrid, but not at the expense of a louder interior on the highway.I do read CR and JDP, and have found that in most cases, the cars that are rated highly, seem to be good bets from my criteria.

The car never broke down or put him in danger due to any malfunction. I have friends who have had to do similar work on Toyotas around 100K, but this is all anecdotal and doesn't prove anything, one way or the other. as with my used-Toyota friends, to extent of annoyance at having these repairs done on a car near 100K partly depends on how it gets dealt with. Some VW owners have complained that the ignition coils have been replaced a couple of times. I happen to have an independent German auto repair specialist who recognized that the master unit which feeds the 4 coils was shorting them out and would keep doing that. With a phone call from me to the VW warranty people, they saw the light and replaced all four coils and the master unit too. Trouble free for remaining 8K+ miles. Again, this, anecdotally, is similar to what I've heard from used Toyota owners at 100K.I also sold a Ford Explorer with 70K on it to a friend. We did all the stuff one does. I showed him all the service records from when I bought the car and he had a mechanic check it out and we agreed that there was no way to know, beyond what was known about the car at the moment, what would happen, but that, if he drove it out to 100K probably some repairs would be needed and it wouldn't prove the car was a lemon.

The non-turbo is a 2.2 while the Turbo is a 2.0. Both run forever. "

My ex recently moved to rural NH, & said she's getting a Large Poodle. I was thinking, a Large Poodle in rural NH, what's wrong with this picture?

"stickguy","September 2006"," Or, ""like taking a junkie to a crack house..""Been hitting the lots in the last week. Not for me, but I am doing leg work to find a new ride for my SIL. She wants a new Luxo crossover-SUV thingee to replace her 3 YO Infiniti FX (hey, it needs new tires, so time for it to go..)So far, I looked at and drove a Sube Tribeca, Nissan Pathfinder and Caddy SRX. DId a showroom only check out of the lexus (GX 350? The Camry based one).Anyway, darn these things can get pricey! Now I was looking at the more loaded models, but MSRP ranged from ~35K (Sube and Nissan) to 45K (Caddy). lexus was ~ 43K, and they did have another loaded Cad for 49k! V6 model too. Might as well get a 'Slade for that money.But, it was interesting since I have never driven any of these. The pathy was a bit too trucky for me, but quick. Didn't like the back seat.The Sube and Caddy impressed me more than I expected. The Tribeca drove very nicely, and didn't seem weak to me. Nice seats, plenty of room, all the basic goodies. not quite as luxo an interior feel, but still seemed like a good value. I liked the interior design, the exterior has to grow on you.The Caddy was large inside, and drove nice. Big feeling (OK< just big) though. But, the Ultraview roof was incredible. I didn't think they could make a single moonroof that big, the sucker was open above the back seat too! That along would sway me.They all had plenty of gadgets, with (natch) Caddy and Lesus leading the pack.Across the board, mileage was sucky. 15-19 (nissan), 15-22 (cad) and 18/19 24/25 ish for the others.Oh, and to get into the 3rd rows, you have to be as limber as my 10 YO gymnast daughter with the 20"" waist. At least the Sube was fairly comfy once I got back there (had enough head and foot room). Forget even trying the Caddy, and the pathy was tight too.I'm still fond of the driving experinece of the Volvo XC 90, and the MDX still does OK, but SIL doesn't seem to be interested in those. I bet she would like the new MDX when it arrives, but that will be costly out the chute.The Lexus was a Lexus. "
"stickguy","September 2006"," probably not, I just get all excited looking at cars. But if you need one of these, the Sube is probably a good deal. The one I drove 9a last '06) had a sticker of 35.5kish, and their first offer was about 30.2K, so there was room to work.$2,500 rebates on the '06 Cad and Sube help. I assume the lexus could be had for about 41K, and I don't think the Nissan is cheap selling yet.If I was in the market for something in this class, I could be happy with the Sube I think. Not sure I could own a Caddy..Oh, that was my other point! In my visit, I saw all the traditional Caddy Cues. A hearse, a DTS with weird Chromes and a carriage roof (and other odd add-ons), a hot young blond in a red XLR (had to be a wife/girlfriend of an athlete, right?), and an older lady in her white pre-DTS big one with the blue half-padded roof.That, and lot's of old people! "
"corvette","September 2006"," The Tribeca looks great on paper (never driven one), but I can't get over the front end. That grille just ruins the car for me. "
"stickguy","September 2006"," Yeah, it has to grow on you, but I don't worry about it too much (unless it is Aztec ugly, which can't be overlooked). I don't see it from the outside that often, so the interior and how it drives are much more important! And it does have a nice, stylish insides, good seats, and it drives nice. "
"growwise","September 2006"," I have been hitting the lots too. Not for buying anything though. One particular car that stood out of all was the Infiniti M35. I saw one obsidian black with a dark brown leather and dark brown wood/brushed aluminium. Interior has to be seen in person. Dark brown was awesome. Wood is not the usual petrochemical bark. It had all the gadgets including lane departure warning, intelligent cruise, phone etc.. This car has now got me interested in Infiniti as a brand especially with new G35 coming out. "
"corvette","September 2006"," That almost makes me want to drive one... I don't really mind the frog eye headlights, but the grille's size and shape need to be drastically changed. I'm not a fan of the tweaks they made to the Impreza to make it look more like the Tribeca, either. "
"woodyww","September 2006"," I'm thinking: Caddy only if they have some terrific lease rates or fantastic deals (depreciation on Detroit Iron, esp. SUV's). Buying a Subie is usually not a bad idea, esp. if you get a rebate/discount. Lexus--if she likes it, hey, it's a Lexus, hard to go too far wrong (for those who can afford it!). If I had a gun to my head, & the vehicle was for me, I'd pick the new MDX..... "
"stickguy","September 2006"," I called, and the sales guy said November to be on the lot. My SIL is looking to do something by the end of this month, plus the deals on the new model won't be attractive for a while.Of these choices, if it were my money, and I was planning to buy and hold, I would get the Sube. Must be the latent Puritan coming out, but I think 30K is plenty to spend on what is basically just the family wagon. The B9 drives nice, lots of room, and pretty much all the luxo/convenience goodies you reasonably need.But, on something like this, I would be tempted to get a lease, so that brings the Volvo and Caddy back into play. But, it isn't my money, and the buyers desire to keep the price down will probably be out wieghed by her desire for the luxo brand badge, and few extra goodies. I'm thinking Lexus if she decides that the 3rd row isn't required. She won't like the pathy when she drives one, and the Sube will be ruled out becasue, well, it's a Sube.The CX-7 needs a look too (I'll hit Mazda tomorrow), but it will probably be rejected, becasue well, it's a Mazda (and that's without me even telling her it is really a Ford underneath!).

All since August.So now I'm realizing that I'm just not bonding with the Mazda pickup. It's reliable, comfortable, gets good gas mileage, and has as many doodads as I'd care to have in a truck. But it has one annoying flaw - the engine revs drop reeeeally slowly between shifts, making it impossible - or at least no fun - to drive spiritedly. I used to rev my old beater truck within an inch of it's life - partly because it needed it, and partly because it was kinda fun. This truck just doesn't encourage such hooliganism, which annoys me. It might as well have an automatic. Yech.I stopped by Carmax to get a cash value, hoping that would talk me down. Nope - they've offered exactly the same amount that I bought it for private party.

They made less than 25,000 of the Mark IIs and finding them with less than 100K can be done, but takes time. The 94s and 95s are particularly rare and less than 400 95s were shipped to the US. Some slight upgrades in suspension, to improve handling, took place in 93, but MR2 enthusiasts seem divided as to their benefit.Check the t-tops to make sure they don't leak. If you keep it garaged and drive only on sunny days you won't even have to worry about the rubber seals. I've seen plenty sell on ebay for $5K or less depending on miles/modifications/wear and tear. The turbos usually sell for $2500-$3500 more for an equivalent mileage. I've seen at least three to four very low mileage turbos bid in excess of $15K and one for over $20K. They have a small, but rabid following.I hope the one you test wasn't totally abused. They really were, and are, great cars. Gogiboy "
"corvette","September 2006"," Most cars that don't have sporting intentions and have a manual transmission hold the revs between shifts. I don't think our 1998 Sonoma did this, but it would have been less obvious, as it didn't have the optional tachometer. I don't remember the Legacy GT I drove doing this, either. And I know our old Beetle TDI didn't.I haven't test driven that many cars with manuals, so I can't offer much more in the way of comparison. I think the rev-holding would get annoying. The Mazda Ranger is a painfully old design, and I can understand it not offering much in the way of driving enjoyment. Ford needs to redesign/replace their US-market compact truck (and US-market Focus), but my understanding is that they couldn't afford to do it. (I actually think the Focus has been dumbed down even more since it came here. The 2000 model I drove was pleasant to drive and had a decent interior. The 2006 model I drove was still okay to drive but the interior was ugly and had a bunch of indecipherable pictograms on various trim pieces.)The rule for CCBA is usually that, if you have a get-out-of-car free card, you take it. But then you'd be pressured to buy something because you wouldn't have a daily driver. So I'd find a replacement before selling it--even if Carmax has to re-appraise it, I don't think the value would drop very far. "

"rayainsw","September 2006"," &#147;How firm is the ride in corvette btw? It must be harsh with the road conditions deteriorating nowadays with all the potholes, bumps and whatnot... &#147;I test drove both a Z51 and Base 2006 C6 Coupe in July.Z51. Not as much ride difference as I&#146;d expected, but expecting to put 15K mi / yr on what will be a daily driver ( unlikely to be driven on a track or auto-X ), cheaper & longer lasting front tires that are better in cold weather, etc. mean I&#146;d be fine with the Base suspension. I did not stress the car, handling-wise, in my drives, and thus would not have been able to evaluate any difference(s) in ultimate limits. I trust the published numbers &#150; as I believe the Quarter Mile ET-s I&#146;ve seen.The ride of the base suspension suits me & my driving requirements just fine. The ride is certainly firm, but I found it well controlled \ damped & I expect that it will be livable for my long trips as well as my commute. Also (and one reason I did not fight the suggestion that I drive a Z51 as well as a Base car) neither of these 2 cars showed any signs of extraneous noise, such as creaks or groans or squeaks from interior plastic bits rubbing or from anything that might not be bolted (screwed, glued) together perfectly. I noticed no wind noise at the (brief) 70 MPH cruise intervals. ( Sound systems were off during all of both drives. ) I presume that it would be the same at any speed I&#146;d be comfortable holding & cruising = typically 80 MPH or so. No vibrations noted at any speeds &#150; in either car. So: The Z51 option I chose not to order, after driving both Base & Z51 at the insistence ( oh, please don&#146;t throw me in THAT briar patch ! ) my dealer. Though winter is relatively mild here in Atlanta, as a Daily Driver this needs to be capable of handling cold temps on occasion. As well as some rather poorly maintained roads near where I work. And the handling of the base C6 is quite competent. My requiring no Z51 is one of the primary reasons I needed to order mine. My dealer orders 95+% of theirs with Z51. As a second ( or third or fourth ) car in a stable &#150; for sunny weekend drives only &#150; the Z51 probably makes sense to many. But not for me.HTH.- RayAn &#150; tic &#150; i &#150; pa - tion . . . "

I am slowly circling a '91 Prelude S, black, paint and interior in surprisingly good shape, around 90K, claiming one owner, they want $3K for it. This is the base model - manual windows and plastic wheel covers. I would offer maybe $2K. But I am still holding out hope that a really well-kept pre-86 Supra will turn up somewhere. They are getting pretty rare, to judge by the number of ads for them. OTOH, everyone and their mother seems to be trying to dump a MkIII ('86-'92). "

Any agressive shifting is lurchy, notchy and generally not fun. I've even ground gears a time or two trying to shift fast with the revs out of whack.I've been on a Mazda kick, I know, but if I could get the local dealer to match Carmax's offer and sell me a Mazdaspeed3 at MSRP or a little less then I'd be sorely tempted - say, the truck + 12k. I don't know if those are out yet. I like the WRX too but for the price I like the 'Speed3 better. This dealer does have a retractable hardtop Miata that I was lusting after pretty badly, but that would only be justifiable if I sold my '74 Alfa Spider, which is less practical but way cooler (I think, anyway).

"corvette","September 2006"," I took Mom's Volvo in to have some work done yesterday. The tilt lever for the steering column was cracked, and someone had installed a zip-tie to try to keep it from falling off. I say ""someone,"" but the only place that has ever worked on it up until now was Swope Volvo of Louisville, and they had it last summer to replace the left stalk on the steering wheel, so by deductive reasoning, they put the zip tie there rather than replacing the part, which would involve disassembling part of the dash. (They also left a piece of insulation in the floorboard.) Keep in mind that these are the same clowns that misdelivered my BMW earlier this summer... Since replacing the lever would probably have taken another day (I also had the brakes flushed, new tires installed, and the oil changed), I left the tilt lever as-is and will try to get the dealer to fix their half-hearted work. I had a 2006 Suzuki Forenza as a rental car. It wasn't great to drive (and the tires were very underinflated), and it had a lot of quirks, like the little horn buttons on the steering wheel (on a 2006 car!), and the dust boots around the stalks on the steering wheel, and the airbag light was on, but it had a lot of features for such an inexpensive car. Finally, I drove a friend's 1997 Accord last night. This brought meaning to the phrase, ""never meet your heroes."" I have always liked the styling of the 1994-97 Accord, particularly the 94-95 model, but this was a lower level model with drum brakes in the rear. The pedal feel was awful--step through a couple of inches of mush, push firmly, and the car still doesn't slow down much. I had to push down very hard to get any appreciable braking. I think the interior had about the same amount of room as my 3-series--it was pretty cozy. The automatic transmission shifted very firmly, even with light acceleration, and the engine wasn't as smooth as I remembered. It had tiny little horn buttons, like the Suzuki, but I can excuse that on a car nearly a decade old.Supposedly, my 3-series will be repaired by next Friday. "

Why would I expect anything else?The mechanic I took the Volvo to is an independent, and I hold them in a little higher regard than the dealer. They don't do tires, so it had to go to a tire shop for that, and one of the tires is out of spec, so it was causing a vibration when I drove on the interstate yesterday. That tire should get replaced Wednesday. Anyway, the indie mechanic *did* change the oil, and didn't overfill it, so at the very least they're better than the quickie lube joints.

"british_rover","October 2006"," Yeah Lightstone is a good interior color although I don't think the piping was navy I thought it was a slightly lighter blue.The volvo interior looked like cream with just a bit of yellow stirred in. Maybe more like a rich French Vanilla color. "
"woodyww","October 2006"," Am I crazy, or do I just have a common bug/I'd say crazy, :-) but that's because those are both vehicles I couldn't afford; &/or wouldn't buy because of the steep depreciation & iffy repair records of LR's & audi's.

And of course, if you want a turn-key car, you are much more likely to get one buying new rather than 40 years old. Owning classics is for people that have lots of time (and money obviously) to devote to their fleet, and consider drives in their cars an event rather than an everyday thing. Now of course, you don't need more than one or two everyday cars, so after that you could have a couple of classics instead of brand new models, but STILL you would have the extra time requirement that classic cars always engender.

"stickguy","October 2006"," stopped to look at a car that has been sitting parked for a few weeks with a for sale sign on it (close to my neighborhood, on the way to work). It is a SAAB 9-5 wagon (I know, but I kinda like these). Not that I was likely to get it, but you know the thought process (kid learning to drive, safe, utile, etc).So I figure, maybe if it is cheap, decent miles, and has the rare stick shift...Well, 0 for 3. It is a 1999, sort of a khaki green color, but an automatic. Not sure what the asking price was, but they had a (very faded) print out of the KBB worksheet in the window (I think it showed private party of about 4-5K).Oh, and a measly 175,000 miles on it!The kicker is, it still had a 30 day temp tag in the back window, dated 9-6 9and I am pretty sure that is the day it expires, but i could be wrong). So someone bought this baby at a dealer or some kind, paid to regisiter it, and is now trying to unload it before ever getting the plates on it (although if you get the temp tag, that means plates are on the way).Wonder if they just came to their senses, or had early dealings with Swen??I should get the number and call just to find out, but that would be cruel.

Issues with seals, top, headliner, etc, are a real pain, and not cheap.. Plus the coupes are more aerodynamic... Those two have really low-miles for 20 year old cars... But, I wouldn't pay extra for that... Any 20 yr.old car will have had the same issues, whether it has 40K or 140K miles....

When push came to shove, it was too much dues to re-locate 120 miles away (I'm on the lower end of the scale when it comes to moving/relocating tolerance). And prices have come down ""some"" in towns/suburbs near Boston from a couple of years ago, so my current plan is to buy a better house around here. Still very expensive, but I remember thinking 20 years ago it was too expensive. (And may still seem insanely overpriced to people not on the coasts).I picked up my 6 (or 7?) y.o. bmw 5 series today. Cost $434 for an oil & filter change, & a repair/replacement to the ""Tailgate actuator & latch"". Not horrible I guess, as it's only the 3rd fairly minor repair the car's needed in the 4 years I've owned it.But that doesn't neccessarily stop me from using it as a reason to try to sell the car, & buy a newer one.

The problem is the patience & work & dues involved in shopping for a used vehicle.....But a $434 service/repair bill on my bmw, if they're not too frequent, wouldn't even pay the sales tax on a $25K or so vehicle purchase.

She has an FX35 now, and is ready to move on.Anyway, I worked through the usual competitors (SRX, RX350, etc.) but she decided that, if possible, she would like to spend less. So, some research on the next tier down (Murano, Highlander, Edge).Ended up driving, and really liking, one that I hadn't even thought about (she was looking at the MT truck preview issue I saved for her, and said it looked nice): the new Rav4.I still think of it as a mini ute of limited practicality, but the darned thing is now just about as big as a Highlander. I took a V6 sport for a drive, and that sucker was nice. Roomy, comfy, very quick, nice ride and handling, plenty of features. 2nd row had lots of room, and the cargo area was large and usable (I saw another one at the soccer field with a full size dryer in the back, with the 2nd row seats up!)Overall, more usable space than the FX, even though it is smaller dimensionally. Wasn't able to see the 3rd row, but CR says it fits 2 adults. She would like to have it for emergency use (Grandparents in, taking th esoccer team home, etc). Even better, the V6 (I know, you may not get this) is still rated at ~21/28 with AWD, way better than the FX. Plus, she really doesn't want to give up any of the power she is used to (I had her look at the Tribeca, but she felt it was too slow).Anyway, I liked it enough, that I would rather get one of these than another minivan!

They said its the nicest car they've ever owned and they love the fact it gets great gas mileage. Since the car now lives just 12 miles away I'm sure I'll be seeing it here and there. Still seems strange to not see it in the yard here where its been all summer, but at least its getting driven now.On another note, its finally oil change time for my Ram and time to cough up some greenbacks for winter tires........10 ply 17s.......OUCH!!! I didn't bother getting a price over the phone today when I made the appointment, but I figure they will run me around $900 or so for the set of 4.

So, no matching spare for this set... On the plus side, they are coming off next month, as the winter set is on the stock wheels.. On the negative side?

It seemed to drive okay although I only drove it a couple of miles. Did I mention they had to straighten the frame?

Not much different than my 330i except for the rear end styling. Interirior is pretty much the same.Of course, the real difference is under the hood. BMW did a very nice job on the engine. Little turbo lag. Very nice low end torque and upper rev punch.But, as my dealer said, equipped ""like for like"" compared to my 330i....the price I'd have to pay would be about a $4K+ swing, adding in the price increase and the lack of discounts on the 335i. He had the one I test drove sold before I pulled out of the dealership parking lot.Is it worth a $4K swing? It might be for some. Not something I would want to do, though.

That might decide it for me, if you don't have Xenons now, or SPP, or whatever, & really wish you had it.The depreciation is probably gonna kill you (or me, us) one way or another. At least for expensive Euro-vehicles. But if you could trade a new 3-series every year for a newer one, at $4K, even $5K per year, it'd cost you $16-$20K over 4 years. A new 3-series is probably gonna depreciate 50% if you keep it for 4 years.Anyway, I'm suprised they'll do the deal for ""only"" $4K-ish....it sounds like a good deal to my demented brain. "

I finally asked how much it was going to cost to add the kid (it will probably be cheaper to move instead), and after getting over the shock, I asked how much to add a 3rd car also (figuring it would be even more ridiculous).Well, it came out to be less to add him and a car than to just add him, due to the arcane rules about assigning drivers. This assumes the 3rd car would be older, without comp or collision. Doesn't matter what he drives, as long as they can assign him to a cheap car.So, i could buy a non-running POJ, and just park it next to the garage, but as long as I kept it registered/insured, I would save money!At least now there won't be any question about getting him a car at 17 (since I don't want him driving mine!)

I would much rather take acquisition and maintenance on anything short of an old BMW 750, as it will be cheaper than the insurance.We will save about $500 by adding a normal, mid-90's+ car, with liability only, since they can assign him to that car. So, 3 cars + 3 drivers will be cheaper than 3 drivers + 2 cars.I did get a quote from Geico, which came out to be about $470/yr cheaper, as we stand now (no kid), but I have not called them yet to find out what happens next year.One saving grace is that most companies don't start charging you until they have a license that allows them to drive alone, so no extra charge until he hits 17 and gets a full one!

After a year of him having his license lifted by ""court of Dad"", I let him drive again. Problem there regarding insurance was the fact that he had a break in coverage. That was my fault.

But, if we add a 1996 Civic, liability only, the total policy would be only 4,100.I have since talked to Geico, and can get insurance right now for less than 1,400, and next year when he gets the permit it will only go up to about 1,800.

I'm kind of surprised your insurance company didn't drop his coverage.stickguy....sounds like youy're experiencing the same rate inflation I did when I added my son....and his subsequent ""driving infractions"".When my son first got his license, all I had were sports cars. That made a huge difference in my policy. Since then, I've stuck to 4-door vehicles. That helped somewhat.But, going to some of the on-line insurance sites, I found there was a big difference in rates from company to company. In general, the brick and mortar insurance companies (like state farm) were much higher. I settled on 21st Century. In the last 3 years, we haven't had any blemishes on his or my driving records. My rates went from ~$5K/year to less than $2K/year after the points expired on my son's driving record. I expect it to drop again after my son turns 21 next year. But, by that time, he'll be on his own and totally off my policy. That should put my rates somewhere in the $600-$800/year range just for coverage on me (and will tempt me to go back to sports car driving). "

Oh yeah, and 4Matic....for under $20k. In this price range, I've tried really hard to steer her toward something that will cost her less than her mortgage to keep on the road, like an Accord, perhaps a GM thing (used SLS and DeVille type things are dirt cheap), maybe an Acura TL or an Avalon? She's having none of it. I've also hinted that MBs made more recently than hers (that is, 1988) have been generally less-than-stellar in the reliability department...and that these will never see anything like 500k on an original engine and trans. She still thinks of everything else as 'tin cans', never mind she hasn't bought or even driven another car other than rentals (one of which she's had now for a month) in 15 years. So far she's looked at (and in some cases, paid mechanics to look at):-2001 E320 4Matic, 60k, original owner....looked and seemed nice enough in the ad, but needed $2600 in repairs, not couting the hail damage (not mentioned in the ad)...he was going to 'let her have it' for something like $17k ($500 off asking), never mind that Edmunds says it's a $15.5 car without the hail damage.-2000 E430 RWD, 45k miles, owned by a smoker, she didn't have it checked out after I suggested that despite the miles, $17k is a lot for any seven year-old car, especially one that possesses none of the attributes she claims to want (better in snow, more rear seat room, decent gas mileage, fewer repairs);-she also sent me an ad for a 2003 black C240 wagon....let's see, not much power (less, in fact, than her 20 year-old 300E and 200 pounds heavier), not much room, black, RWD and at the top of her price range (she thought it was a 'bait-and-switch' at $20k til she found out they were $32k base new).-2001 E320 RWD, 101k (which suddenly didn't matter, because she's 'keeping it forever') but 'only' $13.5k; needed $4500 worth of repairs (shocking...on a six year-old 100k off-lease Mercedes? No!)She also doesn't want to look at anything in Chicago (she's in Indy, everyone in Chicago's a crook, y'know), though our selection is probably 5 times Indy's. To top it off, she's moving to the Knoxville, TN area to be closer to my ailing grandparents....I'm thinking it's easier to get a Buick or Cadillac fixed there than an AWD Mercedes, but maybe I'm wrong. Strangely, I've sent her ads for cheaper 100k, $20k 2000 S-class and she's barely flinched.I've shown her everything from 740iLs to LaCrosses.

At least she won't be spending all her time trying to find a mechanic in Knoxville.2) Put the money into the old one. I don't remember what problems it has, other than the tranny, but if it is essentially worth nothing as it sits, figure out what it would cost to give it a refresh (not a restore) and just keep using it.

"akangl","October 2006"," Jolie selling her beloved Sebring?Yup, I sold it. Its not far away and its got a good home. After I got the Ram I hardly drove it, we had 4 vehicles (we aquired a 97 Ford F-250 PSD for $2000 about 6 weeks after buying the Rams) and insurance was a KILLER!!!I put 1300 miles on it, had $980 into the car including tags, new brakes, and a few other little things. Sold it for $2500, could have gotten more I'm sure, but the family that got it needed something low miles and reliable, so I let it go for what they could afford. They only car they had was an ailing 94 Exploder.Sounds like you've got your hands full with your mom, goodness! A friend of ours bought a 2000 Mercedes E-class wagon with 4matic AWD to use for commuting 150 miles/day. She paid somewhere around the $25k mark for it (it was 5 years old with 55k on it) had it less than a year, put over 30k on it (which was amazing considering the time it spent in the shop), and her kids trashed it inside and out. She traded it recently (I don't know what she got in trade for it, was afraid to ask) for a Kia Rio Cinco wagon. Not sure if she went from bad to worse or from worse to bad. I tried to steer here to a Subaru, Honda, Toyota, basically something reliable, but I guess she wanted a Kia. :sick: "

It was really nice, though, and very impressive value for the money. The only thing I had a problem with, and it's a Big Deal to me... The instrument cluster is one of those that's lit up any time the ignition is on, but, the headlights aren't automatic. This creates the impression that your lights are on when in fact they aren't, and I see tons of Odysseys, Altimas, and Lexi driving at night with no lights (I think the Ody and Lexus models have an auto option, but can have it disabled). Now, I think I would be pretty anal about remembering to turn the lights on, but I imagine that, if I bought a car configured like this, driving at night in an area with lots of streetlights, at least a few times I'd be one of those idiots with only the really dim DRLs on.

I actually wanted to look at the new MDX, since my SIL is shopping and I hadn't seen one. Of course, none in stock, but they did have an RDX on the floor.So, I sit in it. Nice interior, comfy seats (although they are pretty confining, so I doubt that more ""portly"" folks will enjoy them). Nice back seat, good cargo area, overall a nice package.Except for one thing: the parking brake (foot pedal) sticks out right where your left leg goeas. When it is off, it is almost like it was puched on, just hanging out in the middle of the foot area.Even worse, it is directly in front of the dead pedal, so you have to twist your leg/ankle around to get under it, and if you aren't careful pulling your leg out, wango!Really poor design IMO, and as sad as it is to say, I would cross the RDX off my list (if I had a list and it was on it) just for this reason.

"woodyww","October 2006"," I've seen some people on the RDX boards ranting about how ""overpriced"" the RDX is, & I tended to dismiss that. But, with NAV, it's like $37K something, right?

"tifighter","October 2006"," We recently had the annual car show in Seattle last weekend, so I went to check it out. It's fun to see what's new in one spot. Sidenote: One car that impressed me more than I would have expected was new R320 CDI. I haven't been much of a MB fan since the last W124 rolled off the line, but I must say this R320, with diesel power and standard awd for $44k was nice. Seems like a good value, and who wouldn't love 398lb of torque AND 600 mile range? We are looking to replace the SO's Protege5, so we spent time looking at that class. Originally, the Fit sport seemed like the choice, but every dealer in the state wants 10% over msrp for them; that's 18k + ttl. Ouch. We sat in it and there is no doubt that the magic back seats are an engineering marvel. But contrary to the reviews I read, I did not think the interior was 'Acura-grade' (as C&D put it). The console between the front seats looked low-rent and low-useful. At 18+K, we can cast a bigger net. Looked at the civic; she liked the interior, but thinks the looks are boring, and that everyone has one. She wants to be exited when she goes in the garage and thinks the civic is as blah as it gets. Also checked out the Versa, which is a pretty comfortable car. The back seat is epic for its size, and the interior feels more upscale than the Fit. Apparently impossible to get one with ABS right now, and most are marked up locally. I have been pushing the 3 hatchback; our P5 has been great and it seems like the obvious replacement. But she isn't so hot on it and has her heart set on the Rabbit. :sick: After all, her dream car is an A3. I so know better than VW, but boy does she love that car. I will admit the interior, per usual VW operating procedure, feels 2 classes above its competitors. And on paper, it is a hell of a value with so much standard equipment for the money. It has been out in Germany for 2 years, and we are currently getting German built ones, so the first year troubles should be ironed out, in theory. Despite all of this, I still feel like I should know better. And how they manage only 22/30 mileage with a 6sp auto, I don't know. The only other thing out there is the Mini; new one is out next spring so orders are closed for the current one. New one will be mark up or long wait, and the only dealer in Seattle is 40 miles south of the city. Stupid. Stay tuned... "

"qbrozen","November 2006"," honestly, i still consider that too high these days. With the hybrid and/or diesel technology available, I'm disappointed with any newly introduced vehicles getting below mid-20s mpg in a big ute, high-20s in a small ute, and 30s in a big sedan. "
"michaellno","November 2006"," I'm disappointed with any newly introduced vehicles getting below mid-20s mpg in a big ute, high-20s in a small ute, and 30s in a big sedan.Is this for combined mileage or just highway only? I've been averaging 24-26MPG in my L300 (182HP V6) with a 4-speed automatic. The VUE has the 5-speed auto. "
"qbrozen","November 2006"," ummmm... ehhhh... hmmmm... sort of combined. I don't really know how the EPA comes up with a combined number. Basically, for me personally, the combined number is usually 2-3 mpg below the EPA highway number.Ya gotta realize that I'm being REALLY strict right now. I'm basing most of my hopes and dreams on mercedes diesels. R320 = 6 passenger 2.5 tons @ 25-26 combined mpgE320 = big sedan (well, midsize, i suppose) @ 34-35 mpg.anyway, i figure EVERYONE should be doing as well now or in the very near future. If Benz can do that with the E320, then a normal midsize family sedan should be getting close to 40 mpg combined, IMHO.By the way, I'm currently getting ~27 in my Accord and we get ~18 in my wife's Pacifica. I won't be happy with anything less than 24 mpg in her replacement vehicle (which would still be a 3-row SUV, according to her) and over 30 mpg in mine (although I may forego a new vehicle next time around, in which case the mileage won't factor in so much). "
"michaellno","November 2006"," Great minds think alike! When I was evaluating the different vehicles for both mine and my wife's purchases, I calculated the MPG for comparison purposes to be 2 less than the EPA highway value. Most of our commute driving is either on interstates (me) or 55-60 MPH 2 lane roads (her), with some stop-and-go driving thrown in.While I like the Benz diesel, I can't afford the asking price of $52K before options. I'll be lucky if the budget for my next new car will be $30K, and even that will probably be 3 or 4 years down the road.Do the Accord and Pacifica both take regular unleaded? "
"corvette","November 2006"," The Accord takes regular. Not sure about the Pacifica. "
"qbrozen","November 2006"," Do the Accord and Pacifica both take regular unleaded? Well... they both take it, but mid-grade is suggested on the Pac. We've tried both over extended periods and noticed absolutely no difference, so we use regular.Oh, believe me, I hear ya on the Benz price. And its exactly why my next car might not be new. I'm seriously considering getting my wife into the R320cdi ($57k when optioned the way we'd want it) and getting a cheap beater for myself. That is if we are still both commuting together and I don't change my mind in 22 months when her Pac goes back to Chrysler.I'm not sure what the advantages to such a plan are financially. I mean, there are probably NONE. But this would be in anticipation of actually keeping the Benz for 10 years, which I've never even come close to with any daily driver (my volvo was the longest at 4 years). So if we pay it off in 5, then maybe I get a real nice car for myself to last 10 years (yeah, right!). "
"graphicguy","November 2006"," While I'm selling my 4Runner, I was really happily surprised with its MPG...about 18 MPG around town and low-mid 20s MPG on the highway. But, as you say, compared to my BMW, those are pretty dismal numbers.As the weather starts to get nasty around here, I expect I'll be using my Mother's Caddy AWD machine. Surprisingly, on the highway, It gets about 28 MPG...with a V8, no less.In SW OH gas prices have been hovering between $1.95 to $2.05 (Costco) for the last several weeks. I was thinking I might keep the 4Runner because of that. But, I really need to thin out the vehicle heard in my garage and driveway.A business colleague just bought a Prius. He's in CA and it allows him to use the HOF lanes, and speeds up his commute considerably. He says he's not getting anywhere near the MPG that's advertised, but he's still getting substantially better MPG than the Lexus ES he traded in.I don't ever think that the consumer will ever get tired of trucks in this country. I've always believed that hybrid technology would affect sales of SUVs and trucks more than it would with cars. Yet, I don't see a big move by anyone to ""hybridize"" their big trucks and SUVs.As good as diesels have become, the U.S. has been so resistant to diesels, I don't know if they'll ever catch on (particularly given how oil companies insist on charging more for diesel fuel than regular fuel).

"michaellno","November 2006"," The reason I ask is that I've been thinking quite a bit about the next car that I get (even though it's several years away).Some models that I really like (the Subaru Legacy 2.5GT comes to mind) require the use of premium (89 octane here in CO), which seems to be a needless expense since so many competing cars make similar HP but only need regular. Yeah, the difference is only something like $.20 a gallon or $3 a fillup (assuming a 15 gallon tank), but why pay it if you don't really get any sort of benefit from it?In fact, when looking for the wife's car, we considered an Outback XT - so much so that we took a test drive and were very impressed - but when the wife found out it takes premium, it was immediately crossed off the list.Am I crazy or do others here think the same thing? "
"woodyww","November 2006"," Of course if you own an older car, & it would cost you a ton to trade it for a new one with better mileage, it may make more sense to just buy the gas.My bmw 5-series gets around 18mpg around town, & up to 23 hwy. Not stellar I guess, but given the safety, luxury, the fact that it's a wagon so I can haul stuff, it seems fine to me.My previous vehicle was a Range Rover. Watching the gas gauge drop, & then buying gas, was truly depressing.....it got between 10.8 & 12 mpg around town, & 15 hwy.....so now the bmw mileage seems great.The other thing I'd say, like to michaell, is: Within reason, I wouldn't let mileage or need for premium gas totally dictate your decisions. Car shopping is too difficult, & there are always going to be things you don't like with any vehicle. The Subaru sounds like a pretty good idea to me. Personally, I wouldn't get something you like less just because the Subie takes premium. "
"qbrozen","November 2006"," i think along the same lines (we're doing alot of that today, apparently).Its kind of like when I traded my Z on the Lincoln. Here I had a V6 with 280+ hp that required premium. I got into a V8 with 280 hp that ... also required premium? I couldn't help but think ... why?? Bigger engine, same horsepower, so shouldn't the octane requirement go DOWN??anyhooo... I suppose if a car was really good on gas. I mean, enough to counteract the added expense of premium, I wouldn't mind. But, currently, that doesn't happen. By the way, the difference has gone up considerable. At least it was up the last time I checked. Instead of 10 cents more to go from regular to mid-grade, and another 10 to go to premium, it was 20 and 20. So about 20% additional charge by today's $2/gallon standards. "
"michaellno","November 2006"," and I don't change my mind in 22 months when her Pac goes back to Chrysler.Yeah, right! In 22 months you'll probably come up with a discard 50 different plans for the next car or cars that you buy or lease. At least, that's what keeps this forum going. Helping others decide on their needs and wants and helping them spend their money.I've occasionally thought about a VW diesel. A guy who used to live across the street from me had a Jetta diesel - with an automatic, no less! - and said that he got pretty decent mileage.My folks owned an MB diesel when I was in HS -- old, slow, smoky, took forever to start with the glow plugs. I have no idea what kind of mileage we got; I used to 'borrow' it for Saturday night jaunts to LA with my friends.I am looking forward to the day where we have the choice of the same type of diesel engines here that are available in Europe - decent HP, huge amounts of torque, and over 30MPG.But, with diesel fuel running probably 30 to 40 cents more than regular unleaded, you'd have to keep it a good, long time to justify the price differential. Not sure that a plan like that is feasible in this forum. "

I'm not sure what the future will hold, though. Its possible it will drop back below regular.

"
"michaellno","November 2006"," According to the VW website, the difference in base MSRP between the Jetta 2.5 and the Jetta TDI is just over $2K.My problem is that I've become sort of 'addicted' to the smoothness of an OHC (or DOHC) V6 when compared to a 4 cylinder. That makes it difficult to choose what I might want for my next car.I'll admit that I'm intrigued by both the Hyundai Sonata (235HP) and Azera (263HP), as both can be had for under $30K easily.OTOH, a 4-cylinder, 5 speed Accord EX (or EX-L) that gets 34MPG highway could work as well.Then again, perhaps I want something other than a 4 door sedan. I've always like wagons, but there just aren't enough of them around.But, I could see myself in a Mustang GT - though the wife thinks that I'll look silly.See! 4 or 5 different options in just the span of a few minutes.

So, that leaves the Mazda 6 with the V6.Hard to justify a wagon when we already own a small SUV. The wife really liked the Pontiac G6 coupe, but the lack of adjustable-height seat belts was a sticky issue - she's 5'2"" and I'm 5'11"" so we need them to adjust so that they're comfortable.(sigh) Well, at least I've got some time to figure it all out - who knows what will be introduced between now and the time I'm ready to get back into the market?

"british_rover","November 2006"," Yeah you won't see any EPA numbers on the LR2 till the end of the year at the earliest. My guess is that based on its weight, a little over 4,000 lbs, and the drivetrain is that it should get around 20 mpg city and mid 20s on the highway. Maybe it will break 26 or 27 on the EPA test but no more.Rover has been consistently improving is MPG. In 2002 a Range Rover or Disco would strugle to get 10 mpg city and 14 mpg highway.Now a Range Rover will do 14-15 mpg city and do 18-20 mpg city.A Range Rover sport is rated 14-19 but can get as high as 22 mpg highway.A LR3, the replacment for the disco, can get as high as 22 on the highway as well. That is a pretty signficant improvement in only four years. "
"sandman46","November 2006"," My mileage keeps getting better on this car with a bit over 3k on the odo. For my straight 9 mile comute on one road, it works for me. For a 4 banger, the car drives amazingly strong. Great low end torque with very smooth shifts up the power band with the slush box. It's a great around town commuter car, which is the reason I bought it. And gas down here is hovering around the $2.27 mark, even with a port within 15 miles.I've always wanted to try a more luxo auto and the wife has already informed me that her next purchase will be some small entry level luxo brand.

"nippononly","November 2006"," What a funny coincidence! I had an hour to kill tonight an figured I would spend a little time on the nearby Chevy lot, eyeballing a few windows, you know? So anyway, I have always kinda liked the look of the Malibu Maxx, so I went over because they had a couple of them sitting right in front, and within 60 seconds the most energetic salesman I have ever met was handing me the keys for a test drive.I found it to have really great midrange punch, but it sure didn't like revving too much. It had one of those toggle-switch shift functions on the auto, but it's still only a 4-speed auto. That and the bloody-knuckles hard plastic and VERY low-rent interior were a real turn-off. The salesman made a huge deal of the dash computer that can calculate your mileage and all that stuff. When we got back, he couldn't understand how come I didn't want to sign the credit app and ""get things started"". He was an annoying little man, but you had to give him credit for working hard. I had made it clear from the outset that I was only window shopping, so I don't consider it my fault that he got so carried away. You had to love his very optimistic paperwork that he started by listing the car's full MSRP PLUS that dealership's $2000 mark-up (on an '06!) as the negotiating price. ;-)Then I stopped by the Toyota store, where they were a lot less desperate to sell, and chatted up Scions with the salesman. Seems I can get an xA with aftermarket cruise and Toyota keyless/alarm for a shade under $15K. I think that or a new Subie OBS are calling my name in the next couple of months, even though I SWORE I wouldn't trade again this year. :-/ "
"michaellno","November 2006"," kyfdx: Speaking of small wagons (and AWD), I saw a Jag X-type wagon the other day..At least you wouldn't see yourself around every corner (assuming your Jag was running..)I went to the Jaguar website to poke around and found that the starting MSRP for the wagon was over $36K! Don't know what invoice is on them, but I suspect that it would still be out of range, budget-wise.There's also the A4 Avant, but that's probably too expensive as well.corvette: I'm driving a 2007 Malibu rental with the 217 HP 3.5-liter engine. When I was driving it around town, I mistook it for an OHC engine--there's very little of the low-rpm clatter that was present in the 3100, 3400, and 3800 engines.When we had the VUE in the shop to have the steering rack replaced, the dealer rented a G6 sedan for me. I think it had the same engine in it and I, too, found it to be pretty well put together. And, like your Malibu, the interior was completely low-rent. Admittedly, this was the entry level sedan; the G6 coupe that the wife and I test drove earlier this summer (I think it was the GTP trim line) had a much nicer feel to the materials. Still, I think that an Accord or an Altima uses higher quality materials. When I bought my L300 in 2002, I took a close look at the (then new) Altima ... I really didn't like the interior of the Altima at the time as compared to the Saturn. I think that the roles have now reversed; the Aura's interior has some bits and pieces that are obviously bottom of the barrel, while the new Altima interior (at least the '06 model year) was much nicer. Haven't seen the '07 Altimas yet so cannot comment on them. "
"qbrozen","November 2006"," According to the VW website, the difference in base MSRP between the Jetta 2.5 and the Jetta TDI is just over $2K.hmmmm... i'm looking at it now and it tells me the 2.5 starts at $20,290 while the TDI is $21,605, so a bit under $1400. BUT, it is almost $2k cheaper than the 2.0T, so i guess it depends on where you start.i'm not sure what options come in any of them because, for some reason, the comparison tool on their website doesn't include the TDI. Anyway, I wasn't exactly thinking of anyone in particular. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure, from a manufacturing standpoint, the cost difference between diesel and gas is far less than the difference between gas and hybrid. HOPEFULLY, we won't have to suffer with the silly packaging BS that manufacturers tend to pull when they throw in 5 options you DON'T want just to get the engine you do want. OTOH, a 4-cylinder, 5 speed Accord EX (or EX-L) that gets 34MPG highway could work as well.To me, this is where my dedication to efficiency starts to take a bit of a turn. I was willing to drop from 34 to 29 mpg and get the V6 6-speed. I want efficiency, but I also want fun. Which is why diesel appeals to me so much, and the E320 in particular. You can still get great performance, while getting better efficiency. "

"british_rover","November 2006"," Yeah I think that is Mark156.

I have had several people tell me they broke the 20 mpg mark on long highway trips with a full vehicle.I am talking like Thanksgiving trip to grandmas loaded down with five or six people and a bunch of cargo.Yeah the LR2 is full time AWD with a FWD biais. Sometime in the next couple of years the E-Driveshaft from the Land-e concept will come out. That will decouple the rear axle from the drivetrain under light load conditions and should be worth a couple of mpg. "
"stickguy","November 2006"," I'm not sure what the advantages to such a plan are financially. I mean, there are probably NONEOK, I'll bite. What the heck does that have to do with buying a new car? Also, I predict that future state for the US will be all premiarily diesel (maybe with some hybrid attachment, but I don't think diesels make sense as a hybrid). Why you may ask? Because the US has a carbon based fuel supply that dwarfs what the middle east has. Only drawback is the fact that it is currently locked up in coal, but the technology exists to convert it to diesel. PA has some plants already, according to the endless campaign ads for Ed Rendell (the gov.)I also like the waste to fuel (I guess diesel again) plants springing up. Nothing like taking all the crop scraps and turning them into something useful, and cleaner burning than fossil. It can even make many large farms energy self sufficient, as they set up little mini refineries/power plants on site.Not directly related to cars, but there will also be a move toward photoelectic roof panels combined with 2-way electricity transmission.I guess I wnet off on a tangent, but the chicken littles that run around squawking about oil running out, life as we know it will end, etc. just haven't been paying attention to history.That, and this country is so based around private autos, that something will happen to keep us all in cars. Who knows what they will be running on, and I bet they are way more effieicent, but they will exist so we can continue to buy and sell at whim. "

Before you get too torqued about the double tier display on the Civic, drive it a bit. The upper readout speedometer is close to a horizon display. This is great because the readout appears closer to optical infinity. That is cool because it offsets the effects of accommodation (the time it takes to go from looking at something close up to looking at something far away)that are a part of the aging process. I am not sure the implementation is 100% what I would've done, but its a great start.

I drove on the summer tires on some very cold mornings with no problems. Low temperatures reduce the available traction of summer tires, but it wasn't a huge problem in normal driving on dry pavement. I wouldn't recommend driving on the summer tires in winter unless you're absolutely sure there's no snow or ice anywhere on the roads you'll be driving on.

It could have pretty much any manufacturers badge on it because of the generic styling, except for the grille on the front.The 3.0L V6 in it is basically a Taurus V6.

"woodyww","November 2006"," Oh, right, the XKR, good point. I guess once I'm into that price range (not that I actually will be!), I'm thinking: bmw, porsche, mercedes, maybe corvette. But I guess that's my personal bias. I should probably revise my comments to say that the X-type seems Ford-like. The S-type, I just don't like the looks--it seems over-styled, like a bmw Z3. So then I remember the Ford connection.Maybe my attitude towards current Jags is because I'm old enough to have read about the E-type when it was current. There was never any doubt about what a Jaguar was then, pro or con.Same thing with Saabs--I was a huge Saab fan, pre-GM.....owned a 9000 Turbo. Drove a 9-5 a few years ago, & it seemed only slightly better than the typical GM rental car..... "

If not, it's being flat-bedded anyway.Personal opinion....bad move by BMW with the runflats...even though I like the Contis that came on my car better than the test drives I did with the Bridgestones.Let's see what the Conti all seasons do.

Haven't found any of either with much promise so far...Wouldn't mind getting an older SVX (another ultra-rare model, sheesh), but of course it was automatic-only, a big no-no...Or perhaps a turbo Legacy from the early 90s, but they weren't especially durable, and most surviving specimens are in pretty rough shape these days.Pretty soon I am just going to have to scratch the itch by picking up another older Integra, maybe a '94-'96, but I am so hoping to find one of the other models.:-( "

He thought it was a real sports car, was afraid to drive it, and thought it would be collectable some day. It sat in his garage in San Diego, mostly, for 15 years except to be cleaned or the occasional drive. I toyed with the idea of buying it from him, but was still in my euro stage.

""That isn't a Grampa car"" she stated.I've started to think about what my next 'non grampa' car would be - BTW, apologies to all out there who might be grampas - and the Honda Accord Coupe came to mind.Several months ago, the wife and I test drove the Pontiac G6 coupe. It was the GTP trim level and we both really liked it except for one issue - no height adjustable seat belts for the front passengers. As there is an 8 or 9 inch difference in height between us, it's sort of important.Does anybody out there know if the Accord coupe has these or not?

"nippononly","November 2006"," Hmmm..some interesting thoughts there.1. the Supra I want is the pre-'86, 2.8L engine. Never a problem with head gaskets, or anything else for that matter - an extremely durable engine. 2. I know the Cressida from that era has the same engine in it - it's kind of a hoot, but the seat material was not built to withstand the test of time - it was this kind of velvety stuff, totally falls apart, as do many other things in those Cressidas. And as was mentioned, finding a manual in that model is virtually impossible. The Supras' interiors were much more durable.3. I would never even consider the very weird-looking, tech-heavy-and-always-breaking Subaru XT (if I could even find one outside a wrecking yard), and I'm not a big fan of the Misubishi VR-4s either, just because they burn themselves out. Actually, most Japanese turbo models more than a decade old are going to be big trouble, except for ones that were absolutely perfectly maintained. 4. That '89 Supra from e-Bay - ick! The bid is at $251, and even at that price the buyer is ripping off the bidder. The engine won't run, the paint is shot, the stereo is gone, the whole dash is done up in some seriously tacky trim with the ridiculous TRD emblem about a foot high on the passenger side, there's body damage, why even go on? Actually, Supras of any generation are very hard to come by that aren't either a wreck or enormously overpriced. The most-unimpressive '86-'92s in particular are so prone to falling apart, they all suck. I would however consider paying $3000-4000 for a very good condition pre-'86 driver.

The silver with black leather 2.5 SL they had inside the showroom was handsome. All the lines come together and inside the materials were heck of a lot better. I liked the silver/titanium accents on the dash. More importantly, it had bose, bluetooth, navigation etc.. Salesman said that altima coupe is coming too at some point but I couldnt care less about coupes. They had 3.5 SEs as well but I am thinking 2.5 will do just fine with gas prices being unpredictable.I think Nissan finally is getting my attention with their all new cars. 07 sentra leapfrogs its predecessor (they had 2.0 SL) with brown leather in it. Its bigger than the original altima (late nineties). 07 maxima is looking sweet as well since they improved the dash and made it more luxurious (read less bumps). However, I cant help but think loaded altimas are going to steal sales from big brother which is looking a tad bit redundant at this point.Quest is redesigned slightly as well and the dash is looking more friendly than the previous tree trunk iteration. Added a little wood here and there but its a mini bus at the end of the day. Might wind up with a minivan someday if my wife has her way.Rest I dont care for much including the X-trail, murano (except for its wide roomy back seat) and Pathfinder (Quest is a way better choice if needing the third row).

I do agree the car looks better, and seems to have nailed the power and fuel economy class-leaders.

Of course, I had to provide a phone number and a model that I was ""interested"" in to do this, but did it anyway.Website (black book?) came back with a number between $8300 and $10K. Upon more poking around the website, I found that the dealer already has two L300's for sale -- one at $13,999 and the other at $14,999.About 10 minutes later, my phone rang. Yep, internet specialist from the Saturn dealer. We spoke for a few minutes, told her I was not in the market at the time, but was trying to get a sense of what my car might be worth in trade. She told me a base of $9400, before options ... as my car is fully loaded, I suspect I could easily get north of $10K for it ... at this dealer.Kind of a shame that Saturn doesn't really have anything that I like well enough to trade my car in on. I do like the ION 3, fully loaded with the 2.4L engine and 5 speed, but it would probably run me $16-18K for one equipped the way I like. "
"woodyww","November 2006"," Periodically I think I want a Volvo, & then I look up the repair charts in CR, & the mood passes.It seems like the car mags are usually pretty enthusiastic about turbo Subarus. The sort of proletarian image, & interiors, might be a bit of an adjustment to someone used to more expensive cars, but Subarus keep coming up on my list of 5 or 10 affordable cars I might actually buy.You drove the 2007 CR-V, I think? Did the lack of hp bug you? I keep thinking that (roughly) for the price of a 4 cyl. CRV, one could get the V6 Rav4 that is very quick., 0-60 in less than 7 seconds I think. But no NAV on the RAV......& from the pics the new CR-V looks really nice, without that outside spare tire that to me looks kind of odd on the RAV4. Hard to find fault with an AWD vehicle that has leather, S/R, NAV, & side airbags for $28,500, list.Sick pup I am tho, 5 min. after I decide to buy a new CRV, I want a Taco 4wd TRD ext-cab P/U (not sure yet if I want the TRD Off-Road Package, or Sport Package, or Indigo Ink Pearl, or Radiant Red)..... "
"corvette","November 2006"," You drove the 2007 CR-V, I think? Did the lack of hp bug you? It was okay in normal driving, but I think the lack of HP holds the car back from being truly fun. The engine is smooth and quiet if you're easy on it, but will make a lot of noise during an enthusiastic takeoff. Nav won't be available until December, and getting the nav guarantees you will get an Ohio-built car, not one built in Japan, where they have a few months' experience building them. (Normally I would argue that there is no difference between a US-built and Japan-built car.) I would probably be looking at a FWD EX-L without nav, as I can get a Garmin Nuvi for less than the $2,000 price tag of the Honda nav system (which does include a back-up camera, on a car that's only 178"" long). Also, the FWD model gets slightly higher mileage, should perform slightly better, and doesn't have the VTM fluid that has to be changed at every other oil service. There's not enough torque on tap to make torque steer a serious issue. I see a lot more AWD models available in my area than FWD models, though. The spare tire on the RAV bugs me--you'd think, by the third generation, they'd figure out how to mount it somewhere else. Instead, they added an optional third row that is useful only for children that are so small they should be in booster seats anyway--and I'd bet a booster seat won't fit back there. Also, the interior on the RAV feels cheaper, and reviews say that the V6 transmission is jerky. I haven't driven one. I'm thinking I either get yet another sports sedan (or wagon), or get the CR-V and plan to get a ""weekend"" car in a year or so. "
"gee35coupe","November 2006"," Anony brought home a Crew-Cab Titan 2WD. It was a hoot doing local trips. But I really didn't know how big the gas tank was. So I decided to take it down to South Atlanta to my sister's house. I filled it up close to home on the way down at a cost of $30 for regualar. My sister is about an hours drive on the interstate. I burned nearly half a tank of gas on the round trip. I filled it up again at the same gas station on the ride back. IT WAS ANOTHER 20$. Needless to say, the Titan went back the next day. No more trucks unless that Toyota 6-speed Tacoma turns up. Or I need one to haul something. "
"akangl","November 2006"," But I really didn't know how big the gas tank was.Not big enough!! Actually the Titan has a 28 gallon tank and the gas gauges are usually pretty deceptive. On both of mine they would read E with 8 gallons left in the tank. I averaged 10 mpg in the winter and 14 mpg in the summer, that's mixed driving. The best I ever got empty was 19 mpg on a long trip and the worst was 9 mpg in the city. Towing was about 7-8 mpg.The diesel I drive now is quite a bit different, I average 14 mpg in the winter and an easy 19 mpg in the summer. Towing it hangs between 12 and 14 mpg depending on what I'm towing. Of course its no where near as much fun to drive, lol, but it is pleasant and reliable. "
"gee35coupe","November 2006"," I drive Hondas one regular basis. Heck, my TSX can get in the 30's in mixed driving if I can avoid zinging too often. $20 worth of gas in one trip was shocking. Heck, the Pilot wasn't that bad. "

I figure Subarus aren't that sexy looking either, but if I got a turbo AWD wagon or Forester, the performance aspect would hopefully make up for a lot. And the snow capability.But not saying anyone else shouldn't get a RAV or CR-V of course.

"corvette","November 2006"," I haven't read that forum, but I think Edmunds is still a cut above many of the others. The manufacturer-specific discussion sites out there tend to be populated with quite a few diehard loyalists who refuse to acknowledge that anyone might have a better idea than the manufacturer in question. Case in point, I complained about the always-lit dashboard on the newer Honda products on one of these sites, and the other forum members turned it into a debate about evolution vs. creationism. FWIW, my roommate has the same issue with her CR-V--the lit dashboard often fools her into thinking the headlights are on. I think she will get used to it, though. "

The poor horse doesn't have any winter coat and it was 24 below zero when she got her. Really nice little mare though, super sweet, polar opposite to our pony, he's a little snot. "
"woodyww","November 2006"," You don't want to look like a yuppie, and you're driving a 5-series?In my neighborhood, one of the ""most desirable"" neighborhoods in one of the most expensive towns near Boston, most people have: minivans, toyo or Honda, Highlanders, an occasional Passat wagon, Accords, a couple of Subies. I think I've seen 2 Benz's in this neighborhood in the 20 years I've lived here, & 3 bmws besides mine (I'm talking cars owned by people who live in this neighborhood, not ones I see while driving around). And all the $1 to $1.5 mil. McMansions, which are now 1/2 to 2/3 of the neighborhood. After a while you start to equate certain vehicles with this lame, yuppie, surburban white-bread stepford-existence (mini-vans & highlanders & the like). And all of the people I've met, or read articles by in the Roundel, who own bmws, have been fairly sick car nuts, who are just obsessed with the performance aspects of bmws (you know, when your eyeballs turn into 2 bmw roundels). But the CR-V sounds like an excellent vehicle, at a good price. Right now, I just read an article by Peter Egan in R&T about how he just bought a 2001 Porsche Boxter S & loves it.

Another friend of ours had one years and years ago and they used it as a generator for the house.

The diesels have been a major relief, especially hubby's since he traded in a V10. He went from spending nearly $1000/month in gas to about $400 in diesel. His V10 averaged about 6-7 mpg, the Cummins hangs around 12-14 depending on what he's doing with it. If he's just driving empty it stays up around 15-16, towing drops it though. Not too shabby for a dually I don't think.Our old Ford doesn't do too bad on mileage, its around 14-15 mpg last time we checked.I am kicking around the idea of buying a small SUV or minivan for a run around vehicle. Something older and cheap, last van I had got well over 25 mpg. I kind of miss the Sebring and its 28 mpg.

Luckily, the ride wil only be about 25 minutes each way.That's why I would've liked a midsize car in our fleet instead of two small ones.

"andre1969","November 2006"," I remember ages ago, Consumer Reports once said that a good rule of thumb for a car to have good 3-across seating, you needed at least 57"" of shoulder room.So I don't think anything like a Honda Civic would ever have a decent back seat for 3 adults. But that's not to say that many bigger cars are any better. I have a buddy with a 2004 Crown Vic, and about the only way you're going to get more shoulder room than that is to go to a van, pickup, or SUV. However, the seats are really only contoured for two people. Try putting 3 people in there and the outer passengers are pushed towards the doors, and the shape of the seat backrest and the curvature of the doors and C-pillar forces them to lean inward. And the center passenger has to deal with a huge transmission hump and an ucomfortable, hard seating position.I sat in the '06 Civics at auto shows, and was impressed with how comfy they felt. It was one of the few small cars that I could actually fit in back comfortably with the front seat all the way back. Still, I guess if you need 3-across seating, a Civic just ain't gonna cut it, now matter how comfy it is for two people. "

While I was out there a salesguy came by and I asked him what he knew about the truck (hehehe, just for laughs), he said it was nice, one owner, low miles (yeah right, 56k on an 04??), no issues. I laughed and said well, you can make up a story, then told him I was the original owner of it and it has lots of issues, ran down the list. He shook his head and said well, I won't be pushing that truck anymore. I guess they have had a few critters try to buy it, but they can't get financed on it. "
"andre1969","December 2006"," over the weekend I found a beautiful light teal colored '79 New Yorker with ~30,000 miles on it on eBay. It was near Pittsburgh, PA. Looked almost brand-new. While the bidding was around $1500-1600 I was really tempted, but then it shot up over $3,000 and I came to the realization that there's better things to spend my money on.And then, just yesterday, I spotted a 2-tone green/teal '79 New Yorker, with the elusive 360-4bbl on eBay. It was in Indiana though. Higher mileage, around 122,000, and not nearly as pristine, but it had this wild teal leather interior I thought was kinda cool. I forget what the bidding got up to.And I have no rational explanation of why I want these. I already have a '79 New Yorker, but it's two-tone cream.

I'm slowly planting a seed in my fiance's mind that we should pick up another used luxury car in the near future. She really wants an Audi A4, and they can be had for cheap nowadays (99/00) but she drives a 2004 Civic with 26000kms, so I wouldn't want her trading that away as it is halfway paid off, and reliable. Last thing we need is two used luxury cars (my Benz and especially a used Audi A4), god forbid they both break at the same time. :sick: The plan is to keep her Civic as her daily driver, and buy her something more fancy for cheap if the opportunity arises. This way if anything goes wrong, she can reverty back to her Civic. But until we go through with our wedding next September there will be no car shopping for us.  "

"dman","December 2006"," Guys, my wife and I were a one-car family in Chicago and b/c she doesn't drive the stick we had to get the auto. I wanted the E46 M3 but not with the SMG so I opted for the ""best"" automatic transmission out there and went with an '01 CLK55.We moved to Washington state over a year ago and had to buy a car here and ended up with an '05 Accord Sedan V6 but also automatic. Reason for this was b/c I interchange between taking the Honda and the Benz to work. I use the Benz when it's nicer outside and when my wife has to haul a few things around in the Accord. However, I do like the Accord for my 38 mile one way commute b/c it's better on gas and rock chips don't bother me as much. It also keeps the miles down on the AMG but I think the market for used AMG's is pretty soft so I'm not sure if keeping the miles low on it is even worth it.Having said all that, I've been wanting to get back to a stick for almost 3 years. I think the ideal solution is to get her something like an X3 or X5 that she can use daily and for me to get something that's stick, is decent on gas and still quick/fun to drive. I don't think AWD is necessary as I can take her ""future"" SUV when the streets are covered with snow (which isn't too often out here).I've bounced around the ideas for a daily commuter for myself. A4, A6, S4, 3 series, 5 series, //M car, and even the new Subaru Legacy GT's. I'm just not sure right now. This might be a good thing b/c I've only had the Honda for 15 months and the CLK for 2.5 yrs. :surprise: "
"mustangfan23","December 2006"," Definity opt for the stick for the S4... I'm sure once you have it purchased, she'll want to drive and that'll be the extra motivation to learn.

Shortly thereafter, her mid-70s, three-on-the-tree Ford Maverick stopped working. We just let the car sit in the parking lot and a month or so later some guy offered us $200 for it and we grabbed it (not very bright). I guess we were pretty broke in those days since I was in grad school and my wife was working a minimum wage job.From 1982 until 1999 we were a one-car family and there were times it was problematic, especially when I had to wait for the bus in sub-zero temps when we lived in Milwaukee in the late 80s. In 99 I added a fair-weather car that is a joy to drive, but is used very, very infrequently. Two years ago we got a vehicle for my wife and I now use our trusty 94 sedan. I guess we will stay with three since we have no payments, the insurance is reasonable and two of them can be housed in our garage.Without much planning we went from one to three cars despite being a two-person household.

It can potentially be critical to have communications &/or a car that is driveable by both people, say if one person is out of commision. An extreme example would be those people that were recently stuck in OR in a snowstorm in the wilderness. If they'd had a working cell-phone, let alone a GPS, food, supplies, it probably would have turned out much better. Of course, for people who live & drive in the 'burbs, can call a cab on their land-line, etc., can always drive their spouse wherever if the automatic car fails, etc., sure, hopefully issues like these won't be problems......

The worse the car is the sooner we get it in trade.As of right now the only two recently released high end luxury vehicles we have not gotten in trade is the 2007 S-Class and the Audi Q7. Makes me think both of those cars are pretty good. "

He just had a job where an automaker conducted filmed interviews with three separate groups (pro, con and intended demographic) to assess the design of their new CUV. There were 8 people in each group and each group was asked to evaluate the interior and exterior design of the concept vehicle (there was no engine).Many were impressed with the blocky design and said how much it looked like a Range Rover and how upscale the interior appeared. Of course, the ""con"" group was less enthusiastic. When the Ford emblem was revealed several folks said despite it's appearance they wouldn't be caught dead in it, which can't have made for the Ford representatives happy.I wonder if some form of it will end up in the market in the next few years. Do you think Ford is using LR designers or just borrowing styling cues from preexisting vehicles? Gogiboy "
"corvette","December 2006"," This probably wasn't the same vehicle, but Ford recently announced their plans to ""dumb down"" the styling of their Fairlane minivan. What the heck?!? The concept already had wheels small enough for a production vehicle and would have been fine as-is, now they're making the styling more rounded and less distinctive. That's one way of ensuring it ends up in the rental fleets. "
"british_rover","December 2006"," Yeah sounds like the Fairlane concept. A lot of people thought it looked like the Range Rover. The only two styling cues it shared with the Range Rover was the floating roof and block styling.Other then that I didn't think it looked like a Range Rover. "

The color is a little dark for my liking, but I might go take a peek just for the hell of it. The mileage and options are attractive, and the price is suspiciously reasonable for this usually inflated dealer. I can't see making a move though...I'd have a hard time justifying parting with the C43 given that it is the most pristine one I have encountered, it too is lower mileage, and it has been so trouble-free. But I will admit, it's too small sometimes.I sat in a new S550 and played with the electronics, the BMW-copy knob was fairly intuitive. But buttons would be best. I have seen so many of those cars now, and they are so nice otherwise...a real class act inside and under the hood...that I doubt some overly complicated electronics will kill it on the market.

But, the miles are super low.For me, would be nice to have a car that's roomier, & quicker than my E39 528i--The E39 just isn't very roomy inside, even with the wagon version. I'm sure an E55 would hit the spot, but I might be too chicken to buy a recent Benz w/no warranty.Everything you said about your C43 seems to apply to my E39--the miles are so low, & I've spent so little on repairs (knock wood), & it's depreciated so much at 6 years old, that I can't justify selling it (what am I gonna do--sell it for $15K--if I'm rreeaalllll lucky--& pay at least twice as much for an E39 M5, or an E55?). The practical side of my brain keeps telling me that condition & mileage trumps a fancier or higher performance model, with expensive German cars..... "
"fintail","December 2006"," Well, I went out this morning not planning to buy it...But I did anyway.The deal was just too good to pass up. Save for a few small cosmetic fixes (that a normal person wouldn't worry about - wheel lip polishing and a small garage bump on the rear end side of the trunk, mainly), it is pristine. It's local, sold at the MB dealer a few miles from me and has always lived just a few miles from there. The interior is as-new. It has the full load save for the phone - heated and cooled seats, nav, sunshade, xenon of course...it's a heavy option car, and I suspect the color is some kind of special order. I am going to research it some more.I took it to my MB specialist and he said it was fine mechanically, with nothing needing attention. He also remarked about the odd color being the only one he's seen, and the remarkable state of the interior. It's obviously never even been exposed to the sun we have here. I drove it on the highway and on some rough side streets. It was calm and composed. So much smoother than the C43, so much quieter. I have to admit that rough ride annoyed me at times.And here was the long part...the negotiation. I told them unless they gave me good money for the C43, that I would sell it myself. They gave me a lowball, a few grand under Edmunds TMV trade in. I almost walked away right there, as I wouldn't be out much (pre tax) from when I bought it. Then I was given a new offer, of more or less Edmunds private party sale price. That combined with the sales tax benefit of the trade in was attractive to me. Finally, I got it down (over a long period...like an hour) to 28K...quite a bit under Edmunds retail TMV. So I am getting a larger, newer, lower mileage, and just as nice car for not a huge deal more, a wholesale price I am sure. This car was delivered in October 02 and must have cost about 90K. That's depreciation!The car doesn't appear to have ever really been waxed. It needs my attention. I suspect it will really sparkle when I am done with it.There is one glitch...the LED for the clock has died. My MB specialist says this will run about a grand. The seller of the car was not going to pay for this after all I did. So I am going to call MB and see if I can get this as some kind of goodwill just-out-of-warranty deal. It's a 90K car 2 months out of warranty!I also bought a 48 month warranty on it...the car is so complex that it kind of scares me. They sold it to me for what they claim was their cost, roughly 2K. So if MB doesn't fix the clock, the warranty will. I have searched the web for MB forums and found very few complaints about the E55, or any of the pre-supercharged AMG cars. I'm pretty excited. Once I get it cleaned up a bit, I will put up some pics. "

"fintail","December 2006"," Those dates after the VIN codes are the dates the codes were first used. I think it's pretty cool you can break down more or less any MB from the time VINs were used the same way you can a muscle car.The clock is a stupid thing. Apparently the LED readout is one big piece under the instrument cluster fascia, so when one bit dies, the whole thing has to go. I can deal with it for the 4-6 weeks (I think) until the aftermarket warranty kicks in, as I suspect contacting MB will get a jerky response...I mean, when you show up and pay cash for a repair they can be pretty jerky. I'll have it fixed at my independent though. The car does have one other very small issue, some seepage around the differential seal. It's a common problem on W210 cars, and the housing barely has any oil on it, just a light sheen you can see on your finger. The mechanic pointed it out, and said $500 to fix, but not to worry about it yet...so that will be a warranty job too. He also claimed I could likely drive the car for a year, sell it, and not lose any money, as the price was so low.I've spent hours now perusing MB forums online...the only issues I can find with E55s are the LED, differential seal, engine mounts on high mileage cars, and MAF sensors on cars where the owner modifies the air intake. Pretty minor stuff, compared to regular 210s. Most seem to agree that AMG cars received some better parts and assembly when new. "

"fintail","December 2006"," I have no clue, to be honest. Sounds typical for MB though. I know my fintail has had seepage in that area since I bought the car, and likely for decades before. It's just covered in gunk now, and I wouldn't dare touch it for fear of what might be exposed  "
"corvette","December 2006"," Congrats on the new wheels! It looks nice!See, you guys, someone finally bought something. "
"british_rover","December 2006"," If it is anything like other mercedes I have worked on you probably have to remove most of the rear axle to replace a seal. Also I have never worked on an AMG mercedes so I am sure they have special parts for the rear diff to handle the extra torque.Also depends on where it is leaking that IRS rear end has a minimun of four seals and might have five or six.The front pinion seal is probably the most expensive one to replace but one of the half shaft seals will be close. "
"qbrozen","December 2006"," that's true. i guess with the IFS, it could be coming from one of the shafts.I would say, with a setup like that, if you start disassembling for one seal, might as well do them all. "

What was it new? $65-$75K?I was looking at a really cool house a few years ago, & the seller had a silver E55 in the garage. The realtor & I were both drooling over it. She didn't know what the ""AMG"" meant, but she seemed to know it was a special car......Having the heated and cooled seats, nav, sunshade, & xenons is almost too good to be true.

The vehicle (post 1998 revisions) was saddled with the reputation of bad transmissions and head gaskets from the 1992-1996 models.I do not think that they are a bad ride.

That means a lot. One of the reasons I own a bmw is that there's a great (albeit expensive) indie bmw shop about a mile away. They also work on Audis, but I haven't had the guts to buy a used Audi yet.Still, if I came across a mint condition A8, or E55, with low miles, like yours, I'd be so tempted..... Good luck with the car! woodie "
"fintail","December 2006"," Compared to the C43, it is so soft and plush. It's much smoother, quieter, the seats are bigger. The side bolstering on the lower/cushion part isn't too hot though, doesn't hold me in place. The C43 had VERY confining seats though, so maybe I just need to become accustomed to a more normal car. AFAIK the E55 had seats unlike all other W210s, in both pattern and upholstery - its a perforated leather on every part of the seating surface.I do have a decent indie mechanic but a couple miles from where I live. I've had him do fintail maintenance too, and he serviced the C43. I had an inspection done before I bought the E55, and he said it looked OK save for the LED and the seepage at the differential gasket. He's the one who told me I could drive it for a year and probably get my money back if I then chose to sell it. My only big worry is making sure the warranty works out. I've spent some time perusing MB specific forums, and don't see many big gripes about W210 E55 durability...much less than 6cyl W210 for sure.Thanks for the luck, I'll post if my newest baby has any tantrums.

I have replaced both rear window regulators and front brake pads out of warranty.While under warranty, they replaced the instrument panel because the clock ran slow, they changed out both sunvisors as both flip-up covers broke off and replaced one fog light as the bracket broke. Other than normal oil changes and new tires, very little has been done.My car shines like new, my headlights are clear (keep garaged).

Seems like it would be hard to fix though, I assume it is covered in the warranty I bought.I'm glad to hear your experience has been OK. I think a lot of these W210s have bugs to be worked out, but I do see many higher mileage examples (a local lot has an 00 E55 with 130K on it), so they must be servicable. I've heard about failed window regulators elsewhere, too.The paint on the car I bought seems high quality too. A quick polish/wax yesterday really brought out some shine. I forgot the lights have plastic covers...mine are fine of course, but I might use some of the plastic cleaner I have to maybe make them perfect.Here's the interior, with the upholstery pattern that I believe was exclusive to the E55.

I too bought an extended warranty for her through the MB dealership in Chicago (I was living there then). It wasn't a MB warranty but it was sold by them, and so far it's covered a lot of little repairs without question. The bigger items were probably a new climate control unit ($700) b/c the button on mine was stuck and new motor mounts ($500). Been a great ride so far. What scares me the most are speeding tickets.I noticed we are in the same area (I live in Kirkland). You go to any of the car meets?

I do plan to keep it that long...of course, I said that about the previous car too.I haven't been to any local gatherings save for an informal W202 group, where there was no driving, just looking. I was going to pop in at the local annual MB club show and shine last summer, but by the time I remembered it, it was a month in the past. I'll have to remember this year...and by that time, I should have the E55 up to my OCD level of condition. "
"boomchek","December 2006"," Your CCBA membership is in good standing now. The E55 must pack a good punch. How does it compare in acceleration to your C43? Give it another year and you'll be in a S55 or CL55 AMG.Speaking of the clock LED I'm not surpised at the cost at all. It reminds me of 99-04 Honda Odysseys that have a backlight behind the clock on the dash. When the light bulb burns out, the clock is not legible at night. But to replace it, one must take apart half of the dash to get to it, and end up costing about $200.Anyways enjoy your new ride. Please provide a full road test review here for all of us whenever possible. :shades: "
"akangl","December 2006"," I'm having some sort of buyer's block. Found a nice horse trailer, good price, but talked myself right out of it. Can't seem to bring myself to buy a darn thing. Well, that and I'd have to have a hole cut in my truck for the gooseneck hitch.Could it be I'm cured? Course that could present a problem since I do need a horse trailer. "
"fintail","December 2006"," It's really a different beast. It is quicker, althogh almost imperceptibly. However, it is a hundred times quieter and smoother, so the speed really comes up on you. It also has about 90lb/ft more torque, so it seems higher gear acceleration is better. And it also has the traditional old time heavy MB throttle, so you have to give it a little extra to get moving...and then you really move. The C43 had a lighter throttle, more like a normal 4 or 6 cyl car.I'm not too hot on the supercharged engines...I really have paranoia about that part failing, and a general worry about W220 cars. I might have to hold off for a new 63 series car. I was thinking about waiting several years and maybe replacing the C43 with one of those oddball E55 wagons when they depreciate to my level. But maybe not, now. One of my requirements is to have something unusual. I have found out that there were 83 tectite cars sold in 02...so that's pretty unusual.The whole cluster has to be removed to replace my defective LED, too. I notice only about 40% of it is actually dead...so you get the minutes and maybe half the letter for the gear selection. Just no hours.As I discover more, I'll post it here or on a MB thread. I am still learning the ins and outs of it. I've been working a bit since I took delivery, and the weather has also been less than cooperative. I'd like to get a nice set of pics soon. "
"michaellno","December 2006"," and the weather has also been less than cooperative.Um, yeah, you could say that. Hope that all is well up there ... your storm is heading our way and should be here by tomorrow or Sunday.Here's hoping it stays in the mountains!So, your E55 is the 349HP version?

"corvette","December 2006"," I stopped at the Honda dealer on the way home to my parents' house this afternoon. Best offer I could get was $500 off list on a CR-V, but they have a $195 doc fee, so effectively, $305 off MSRP--no accessories, protection packs, pinstripes, or other gimmicks. Now, the markup on the one I planned to order or buy is $2113, which is not huge, but there is also a 3% holdback... I didn't pay $1800 over invoice when I ordered my 3-series (before the car was even released), it was in demand at the time, the car came out of the dealer's allocation just like a normal sale, and there is no holdback on a BMW, so, I guess I expected a similar deal with the CR-V. Maybe it's an omen!  "

One for $450K, on a hill, about 1500 s.f, OK shape, nothing special, you'd need a pack mule to get groceries, etc. up all the stairs up the hill. Another for $517K, about the same. It's STILL astonishing how little you get around here for +or- $500K.Go North 100 miles--near portland, ME, around $400K will get you a really cool house. I mean, a VERY cool house, with a great kitchen, maybe 2000 s.f., in a great neighborhood, near both the ocean, & the city (portland). And near tons of seafood ""joints', cool restaurants, etc. nearby.

"corvette","December 2006"," Haven't driven the CX-7--but I think there are some lease deals on them right now. There's still a really attractive lease deal on the Audi A4, too, but I'd be 70 miles from the closest dealer (same as with the Mazda). Something to think about... "
"kyfdx","December 2006"," Shop around on the CR-V... There is about an $1800 spread between MSRP and invoice.. I'd guess that $1000-$1300 off would be achievable with a little competition. Getting the vehicle you want is more important than the last $500 of the deal.. Getting a RAV4 at invoice vs. $1000 over invoice on a CR-V won't matter much, if it is really the CR-V that you want.$400K-$500K will buy you a McMansion where I live.. 3500 square feet, easily.. "

And I'll probably e-mail Swope and one other dealer asking for a quote on the CR-V, but, if he's still working there, I think I have a contact at Bluegrass Audi that would do the advertised A4 lease without any gimmicks--it's awfully tempting.

"british_rover","December 2006"," question here.Why do you want a CR-V? You are about as far away from that targted demographis as possible. "
"boomchek","December 2006"," I freaked out when I got my C240 and the fuel economy was about same as yours :surprise: . On long drives it all balances out anyways. Since resetting my trip computer when i picked up the car over a month ago my average has been 20MPG, all city driving. "
"corvette","December 2006"," I'm asking myself the same thing after getting turned down at the dealer yesterday... My thinking was that I could buy the CR-V as a very reliable, everyday vehicle, and in a year or so buy or lease a Z4 or similar unpractical vehicle for recreational purposes. I'd like a daily driver that's a little more roomy than the 3-series, and a little more reliable than mine has been. And, I've discovered that I don't really enjoy driving a manual on a daily basis, although it's great fun on a winding country road. I still want at least six airbags and stability control as far as safety features go... I will throw open the floor for suggestions.  "

"woodyww","December 2006"," I may sound like a stuck record, but, being as you're into ""performance cars"", bmw's, etc. I'd think the extra hp of the V6 RAV, or the Forester Turbo, would be very appealing. It would be another matter if the hp of all 3 were ""close"", but it just seems like Honda is being really chintzy with the 168 (?) hp in the CRV, & the turbo-4 in the RDX ($33-$37K, & you don't even get a 6 cyl???). Around here, my 6 cyl 5-series is quick enough to not get me ""run over"" (knock wood!)--it does 0-60 in about 8 seconds. I think--the CRV is closer to 0-60 in about 9.9 seconds--& the V6 RAV is in the mid-6 second range; the Forester Turbo may be even quicker. (I'm too lazy too look all of this up right now). Of course, that's just one way to look at it; it's not like a CRV is exactly a dumb choice.... "
"qbrozen","December 2006"," it just seems like Honda is being really chintzy with the 168 (?) hp in the CRVdepends on how you look at it. its not like they wouldn't charge more money for the V6 model, so I don't think its a matter of being ""chintzy"" since they'd make more money. I have to imagine they just don't see enough of a market there at this point. Maybe with all this new competition they will change their mind in the near future? "

What you see is what you get.I had an interesting conversation with a greenpea about a 350Z I test drove there. It was WAAY overpriced. I made an offer and he immediately informed me of their policy. I explained that they were way over market value, so why would they not negotiate. No answer. I wound up buying one that was a year younger, with half the mileage, for less than they were asking for theirs.In addition to that experience, a friend of the family has purchased 2 vehicles from them (a person who doesn't want to negotiate anyway, regardless of my objections) and they've had nothing but problems with the vehicles (and why they would go back a second time after all the problems with the first is beyond me .... but as we know, you can't save some people from themselves). They bought warranties on each car, but its strictly an autolenders policy, so you have to go to them to get it fixed (something they are apparently not too good at doing). "

"stickguy","December 2006"," Yeah, I also find their prices to be quite hig, and non-negotiable.

Something about a customer of his (or potential) that ended up buying a car at A.L., and it didn't seem right, so they brought it to hi and it turns out that the whole side had been wiped out and (poorly) repiared.

It's very well finished and the materials are nice - the dash is a huge swath of soft-touch material. The seatbacks are nice, but the cushion seems too short. Some of the controls are weird...I am so used to MB, I had to think about the stalk light controls, and the foot action to release the parking brake. I do like the keyless start though.

Obviously, that is not possible with this setup. Has it gotten to the point where such a situation would NEVER come up?

I was just annoyed that it embarrassed me when I thought I was releasing the brake, and I popped the hood! Then I remembered some cars do it differently. I also had a hard time with the windshield wipers in the dark too...stalk on the left that you move to activate. Weird. The headlights are also on a stalk. There's also more engine noise than I expected...but it does ride softly.Oh yeah, I said ES330...it's an ES350, the new style. "

Now the back seat has marker and crayon all over it, coffee/soda spilled on the carpet, its just trashed. I think the truck has about 15k on it and is a year old. I think he said he financed $51k on it (full msrp) and his kids have aided in its rapid depreciation. His wife had a 2000 Mercedes E-class wagon 4Matic, was a nice car but the kids destroyed it, it had big scratches and scrapes from them hitting it with their toys and such, interior was trashed. She traded it recently for a Kia Rio.....go figure, lol. :sick: I would disown my children if they did things like that! My daughter helped order my truck and since she wanted black she now helps wash it too!I dread thinking what my truck will look like when we get back from Washington after driving 5200 miles round trip. *shudder* Gonna take me a week to get it clean again, poor thing.

I tell them if they feel the need to trash a truck go mess with the 97 Ford, that truck is beyond help, we don't even bother to wash it or clean the interior anymore. I had a friend get in my truck a couple weeks ago, he was riding in the back seat, first thing out of his mouth was ""your kids don't get to ride in here do they?"" I said sure they do, all the time. He was impressed by how clean the truck is.I take excellent care of my truck, even the Titan after 56k miles and 2 trips across the US it was still in really good shape on the inside. Exterior I don't have much control over, rock chips, scrapes, stuff that other people do to it, well, that just happens.My black Ram right now has 4 rock chips on the hood, a chip in the windshield, and a lovely broken foglight, all thanks to DOT's obsession with putting rocks down on the hwy in the winter. Not to mention a few scratches thanks to some darn ravens that seem to have a thing against my truck, drives me nuts too, especially when they feel the need to poop on it. I wash it regularly, then add in a clay bar treatment and wax a few times a year, 'bout the best I can do for a black truck. I also removed the factory floor mats and put them in my closet, I have a full set of Husky Liners, MUCH better to keep junk off the light grey carpet.No animals in my truck either, can't imagine what a dog would do to light grey leather........ :surprise: .

"fintail","December 2006"," Maybe I get my ways from my parents, but in reverse. Although they always took mechanical care of their cars, they rarely kept them clean or cared about the bodywork or interior. As I got older, that kind of bugged me. I remember when I was little, my dad would wash his car like twice a year. It seemed normal then. I can't imagine doing that now. I don't freak out over rock chips or an occasional small ding, but trashed interiors and scrapes/dull paint get to me. I also obsess over wheel scrapes and cleanliness. A condition of sale on my new car was having the wheel lips polished (and they did a fine job)...MBs also have a bad tendency to dirty the front wheels very quickly, so that annoys me. "

"nippononly","December 2006"," ""How do you like the C240 vs. the Honda you traded?""I am curious about that too. I was doing a google search tonight for a specific Mercedes Benz dealer in my area (but not my local one) and instead of getting the dealer I was looking for, I got a massive consumer complaints page about the C-class cars, including some of the last models of the sport coupe as well as the current sedan. There were just pages and pages of people with problems with their C-class cars, including a number who specifically mentioned trading out of a Honda and praying to their deity of choice to give them a way to go back to Honda and never darken Mercedes' door again. It was a depressing read.I was looking the other night at a 2000 E320 4Matic wagon, 78K miles, white, advertised by a local dealer (not the MB dealer) for $16K, and I was thinking it might be fun to take it for a whirl. But of course, it would have no warranty at all. Maybe not such a fun whirl, huh? :-/ "
"corvette","December 2006"," Wow... Do you think you can make it the rest of the year without buying another car? :P "
"woodyww","December 2006"," That's kind of my thinking on trading a Honda for a C-class. I just looked at the Consumer Reports repair records on the C-Class--it's very depressing.

"anonymousposts","December 2006"," but it's not as satisfying to drive a demo because it's not your car. You can't tint the windows, put nicer rims on it, or anything to personalize it. It's just a car that you have access to. With that said, I am thoroughly enjoying it and it has definitely slowed down our CCB ways. We have had the Accord for 2 1/2 years with no immediate plans to get rid of it. 53,000 miles and still drives and looks like new. My current demo is a 03 TL Type-S. Gorgeous car. Pearl White w/ tan leather. NAV. 27k. It has a lot of the accessories like the underbody spoilers, wood-grain accents, and fog lights. If I wanted an automatic sedan this one would be high on my list even though it's the previous body style.As for the pet issue, we have two cats but you wouldn't know it. They are declawed and they hide from company. They go potty where they are supposed to and aren't destructive. As for the kid issue, our son leaves lots of toys in the car, but he doesn't really eat anything other than french fries in the car so they stay pretty clean. "
"boomchek","December 2006"," Well I had the Benz for just over a month, and so far I'm loving it. I like all the little creature comforts, and it's hard to compare it to the Civic I had before that. I love the looks of it, the way it drives, and just the overall feel of it. :shades: I am paying double for gas compared to the Civic I had, cause this takes premium gas and it's a V6.One thing with luxury cars is that it takes a little more money in upkeep to drive them. My Civic was almost new, this one has about 90k miles on it, and even though it's a Benz I have to be prepared that something might go on it.Case in point the power steering leak that I have now. Yes it's a bit frustrating, but I can deal with it. :sick: I saw that MB complaints page as well on the internet (looks very much like an official MB web site but it isn't), and I did read some complaints. I can understand some complaints, but others, like burnt out lightbulbs should be non isuues. I had three light bulbs burn out on me so far, but then again there's about 23 light bulbs on the car. I would be a bit choked too if this would be a brand new car, but thankfully I don't think I will ever be upside down on it because I picked it up for so cheap. I'd be more worried if this would be an S Class and I'd be paying $1000/month, AND have problems with it. :lemon: In addition some of the complaints on some of the pages seem like they're written by the same person. Case in point, one page has complaints about SL500s, and half of the entries in there have horrible grammar and spelling. I don't think anyone who drives such a car would have problems with their english. If you do a search you can pretty much find similar complaint pages on almost all luxury cars including BMWs and Jags. It's hard to find a prefect trouble free unique car nowadays unless you want to drive appliances like Toyotas or Hondas (well Hondas are more fun appliances).Driving a Benz is like having a high maintenance girlfriend. She may look hot, and turn heads, but leave you paying along the way. :shades: And life is all aboput different experiences, so a little adventure with cars doesn't hurt.  "
"woodyww","December 2006"," Driving a Benz is like having a high maintenance girlfriend.Yeah, my Range Rover was like that.

At least for a while.....I guess for me, bmw's are what I ""know"", or think I know, from owning a couple, & reading the Roundel, etc. for many years, so I tend to gravitate to bmw's. The Land Rover Obsession was a bit hard to get over tho, even after owning one that was in the shop a lot.

"dad23","December 2006"," So maybe this is the CCB in me...We had one of those special 2 year leases on the Odyssey, ended up buying it after the lease ended on a 5 year note at $380/month.

I'm wondering if it would make more financial sense to lease a new one even though we'd own nothing in 3 years, or continue paying for the 04 and own it in another 4 or so years with it being worth ??Am I trying to reason myself into a new car  "
"corvette","December 2006"," As Terry would say, it depends, and I'm not talking about the kind you wear...What is the van worth now and how much do you owe on it? The upshot is that you would get a new, nearly identical van, under warranty for the term of the lease. If you had bought the original van on a 7-year note, it would have probably end up costing $34,000 as well. Your current van won't be worth a whole lot after it's seven years old, but it's better than the -0- you'd get back at the end of the lease. On the other hand, it looks like it would only cost a little extra to replace it every three years by leasing, as compared to replacing it every seven years by financing. "
"dad23","December 2006"," Well, FWIW, Edmunds/KBB/NADA show trade value as $16400/$17400/$18600. We currently owe $17800 on an 04 EX-Cloth with DVD and 28K miles. "
"corvette","December 2006"," Well, you aren't going to be ahead in cash flow by getting back more than you owe on the van if you sell it. And, it's not like the Ody has a bad reputation for reliability. This may be heresy here, but if it were me, I'd lean toward just keeping the current one and re-evaluating when a new model that you're interested in comes out. I'd go ahead and pay the $50 extra a month (that you were considering spending on a lease) on the note on the current van if the interest rate is more than 3-4%. "

"fintail","December 2006"," It's online:http://www.mbclub.ru/mb/vin/?lng=engNow and then an option code will be out of date, but it's pretty accurate, and really pretty cool. It will work on any MB made since standardized VINs came into usage. "
"boomchek","December 2006"," Thanks, I'll check it out. We took in a 2001 MB C240 with 60k miles on a trade and I had a look inside, and the power steering is making the same noise as mine. Seems like it might have been a common problem on these cars. "

"boomchek","December 2006"," Thanks Fintail. I just got my car decoded, and it seems pretty accurate. I wonder where they get the info. they must have some kind of a hook up with the manufacturer or the factory. "
"fintail","December 2006"," Nope, I've never seen anything like it for any other makes.There is a page for pre-VIN MB if you have the original data sheet...so you can decode the numeric option codes (like deciphering the numbers on an old muscle car), but I've never seen anything else. "

"woodyww","December 2006"," The A4 sounds awesome. (I was wondering what would happen w/the CRV idea). If you don't mind, what are the details on the Audi lease? "
"corvette","December 2006"," The ""ad car"" was $379 per month and included a 2.0T model with Quattro and a six-speed auto and premium package (17"" wheels, sunroof, and real leather). Mine has that plus metallic paint, a sport suspension, and heated seats, which increase the MSRP by about $1,000 and together add $10 to the monthly payment, so $389 per month plus my state's 6% sales tax makes my payment $413 per month. The first payment was due when I agreed to the deal, plus the $575 acquisition fee Audi charges, and the dealership added a $425 doc fee. I probably should have dickered over that but didn't because even with the doc fee, the selling price of the car was below Edmunds TMV. And, they used Audi's base money factor. 15,000 miles per year. Long story short, $1400 in fees and first payment to get out the door, plus the $413 per month payment. Only the 5,000 mile service is free, so I'm on the hook for the 15k and 25k at about $200 a pop. If I don't buy the car at the end of the lease there's a disposition fee of about $300--I don't have the paperwork in front of me right now. It's not as sporty as the BMW, but the ride is more compliant on rough roads, and the interior is incredibly nice. The engine has plenty of torque and no turbo lag, and it's more quiet than most four-cylinders. Fuel economy appeared to be in the high 20s on the way home (highway drive), although I have only a distance-to-empty gauge to go by and no on-board computer. I'm rolling the dice on reliability. "
"woodyww","January 2007"," I've had serious cases of Audi Lust in the past. But I always chickened out before buying one--I think leasing is the way to go with an Audi. It's kind of cool that the state only charges you sales tax on the mo. payment--is that correct?If I figure the depreciation on my 5-series, that I bought at 2 years old, it comes to at least $5K per year. Maybe $5K/yr. depreciation or lease payments is the minimum to enjoy a new or newish Euro. auto(?).Sounds like a very cool car--I wonder if the looks & interior aren't even nicer than the 3-series? Anyway, congrats on the new ride; I'm envious of the Quattro this time of year!Woody "
"corvette","January 2007"," Yes, Kentucky only charges sales tax on the monthly lease payment--although, I think that's true for most states, as that's the result you get when you put the tax rate into a standard lease calculator. If you buy the car at the end of the lease you pay sales tax on the residual value. The interior is much nicer than the 3-series. There are a lot of little storage bins throughout. Minor gripes: The steering wheel radio controls are poorly designed and the power window switches feel extremely cheap. I really like the looks, but I think it's a toss-up between it and the 3-er. The Audi's higher ground clearance is convenient for aggressively-angled driveway entrances, and the ride is noticeably softer but still has that Euro feel to it. Haven't really experienced the Quattro yet--it's been unseasonably warm here the past couple of weeks. I don't think $5k a year is a bad price to pay to get the best two years of a $34,000 car's life. And, once I sell the 3-er, I'll have something in the bank to help pay for the next car. "

"mark156","January 2007"," I've decided that it's time to go shopping... For a Motorhome! I have been looking for quite sometime and have rented units for the last three years. Now, the rental fees can go towards a purchase!I'm ready to travel the USA and Canada (over a five year period). The unit that I'm looking at is 43 ft, 4 slide outs, 400 hp Cummins diesel, nav, solar power, dishwasher, stackable W/D, king bed, tandem axle, opposing leather sofa's, etc.I just need to check which dealer will give me the best deal as I have found at least 3 that have the unit that I'm looking for.Mark156  "

"mark156","January 2007"," Guss, luckily... I'm not financing.. the money is coming out of my private funds. I think motorhome loans can go for 20 years if you want them to.I was impressed that the dealer immediately knocked off 24% of MSRP without much prodding. I think that is fair.I'm still looking around and will probably make my decision in 3 or 4 weeks. Can't wait to get started on traveling down the road!Mark156  "

I don't know when she'll act...but I get a sense something is coming soon, and she'll make me her advisor. Like many 60-something women, she has a thing for the Avalon...but I know she won't want to spend that kind money. I might have her look at year old Lucernes or 500s.

"akangl","January 2007"," Don't buy new if you can avoid it, those things are the depreciation KINGS!!! We bought a new 2004 Fleetwood Wilderness Yukon 24BH travel trailer, paid $21k for it or something like that and a year later it was worth $7500 trade and $12k retail. Our trailer is immaculate, very well cared for, no pets, non smokers, ect, but when we looked at going to a bigger trailer we found that ours had lost all its value. I WISH we had bought used, could have picked up a 1 year old travel trailer that was MUCH bigger than the one we have for 1/2 the price. Lesson learned, won't do that again. We'll probably keep our trailer for another 2-3 years then move up to a horse trailer with living quarters.Also, if you can get a low rate you should finance the thing, the interest is a write off on taxes, just a thought.

"mark156","January 2007"," qbrozen and akangl.. believe me, I know that I could save by buying used... but, I want brand new as the 2007 model has so many updates over the '06 model.If I decide to go with this unit that I drove today (still looking at two different brands) they are giving me a really decent price (76% of MSRP). I will keep this unit for at least five years or more. After taxes and all.... I'll be out about $300,000.... but, that's what I've been saving it for and I can handle it. My moto is.... pay cash, never finance... and I've done that since 1988. Everything I have is paid for or I don't need it! I'll retire totally in 1.5 years at 50. Yeah!!!

"gee35coupe","January 2007"," For the last few days we had a 06 Saab 9/3 Aero. It was a nice car as far as looks and powertrain. But for a car with less than 7000 miles on it, it creaked and groaned like crazy. They say the new Malibu is going to be built off this platform, doesn't bode well. Our 45K Accord has fewer creaks even after I put the 17"" wheels on it.But as for the V6 turbo with a 6MT...That was a dream combo. I loved the engine in that thing. It felt invincible on the freeway. The power was everywhere. And keeping it below 100 mph required the cruise control.But....With all the creaks and rattles, I can see why this brand new loaded Saab had already lost $10k off MSRP. We took it back yesterday and ""traded"" it for a 05 TL 6MT. I drove the TL home and I miss the turbo but not the rattles.Having the opportunity to switch up to 5 cars a month goes a long way to quelling our CCB. But then again, this may be CCB nirvana.

"nippononly","January 2007"," that Toyota dealers (in my area anyway) are selling Tacomas pretty much at invoice right now, so that black 4x4 V-6 6-speed would need to come down a good $2-3K IMO. But it IS certified, something I value enough to add some dollars to the price. That thing would have a sticker of about $29K brand new, I believe. I think the gas prices, in general, affected SUV owners a lot more than they did pick-up owners, who I am guessing actually use their trucks for trucky things much more often.

"mark156","January 2007"," Woody... The motorhome bug can't be explained. There are no good reasons to convince anyone that the purchase makes sense or being cost effective (which it not) It's not a cheaper way to travel, it's just a ""different"" way to travel. I have done all type of traveling, been around the world but haven't traveled much in the USA. There is a whole lot to see in our own country.There are trips where you can put your motorhome on a rail car and travel across Canada. The train will stop at night and you stay in your motorhome looking at the beautiful scenery. At certain locations, there are out-trips with a tour guide and transportation. The trip is also done in Mexico. It's like what I learned in College in one of my accounting classes... If you are working as an accountant in a fortune 500 company and the president wants a private company jet, how do you validate it? You don't, if the presidents wants it, its a done deal. :surprise: I've done the car thing over the years. Porsche's don't really excite me. Now, the Bentley Continental Flying Spur convertible is a hottie!Andre.. I'm looking at the Monaco Dynasty, Monaco Camelot and the Tiffin Allegro Bus (over 40 ft. will get you the tandem axle). The rear axle will lift automatically under 8mph or I can raise it with a touch of a button if needed. www.lazydays.com----you can find the brands there and see pictures,etc. Monaco uses the Roadmaster Chassis and Tiffin uses the Spartan chassis. Both are good.I have friends that have spent double what this will cost on their motorhomes. I'm in the ""low"" end group.Also, I'll have to buy a small SUV to pull behind the motorhome, thinking of a Jeep Liberty, Honda CRV or a Toyota Rav4. The diesel Liberty might be nice. Can't wait to get on the road! Mark  "

I thought I read that Suzukis can be flat towed and if the trans is in neutral, it won't put miles on the ODO.The only other issue is that in most states, if the trailer ways more than 1000 or 1500 lbs, it needs its own brakes. Were you thinking of getting a ""brake buddy"" or something similar? Alternatively, you can get a dolly that has brakes (electric or surge) and then not have to worry about it. "

Maybe I'll call the dealer with the black 4x4 V-6 6-speed & see what they'll do--they also have an ""internet"" sales guy who seems to have good prices on new Toyotas. As I recall tho the prices on used Toyotas at Toyota dealers are usually pretty high & inflexible.The 7 yr. warranty on a used one would be great tho.

Which is fine, but why not just drive the little SUV there, & save $300K?One could stay at Four Seasons level hotels or inns a lot every year with just the income that $300K would generate.....& you'd still have the $300K.

Not sure how many Four Seasons take pets.2) We can go where we want, when we want. Not too many 4 star hotels at our National Parks.3) We would avoid the hassles of modern day air travel.4) Sometimes, the journey is more interesting than the destination. Which means we can simply choose a different destination.Anyway, I don't want this to decline into an ""I love / hate Motorhomes"" discussion, or one on how others choose to spend their dollars.I just wanted to add my .02 to this, in as non-confrontational a manner as possible.

We love it. I don't think we'll use the TT much this year since we'll be busy with the horses. It'll come home from storage in May and we'll have to find room for it around here.

"smittynyc","January 2007"," I can't fathom it either. Don't get me wrong -- there's pretty much nothing I like more than taking long highway trips. I once drove from Tucumcari, NM, to Chicago with just four quick stops for food/gas/toilet. I can do a NY-Chicago or a NY-Outer Banks or a NY-Portland ME as easy as falling off a log. I spent breaks in college driving all over the country to places I hadn't seen before. But note the emphasis on ""driving"". I've never been lucky enough to make these trips in fancy cars, and I've even made them in some crappy ones (like a 91 Tempo), but I always pushed the car as best I could and had some fun out there. Being trapped in the right lane watching a parade of four-wheeled and eighteen-wheeled vehicles zooming by would have me fit for a straitjacket after about the first 100 miles.So until they invent a motorhome that can be economically flown ahead to my next destination, we'll go the hotels and restaurants route.

"mark156","January 2007"," Guss, I'm sure you are kidding but a $331,000 motorhome (the one that I'm looking at) will not immediately fall to $150,000. What I have found is they will fall about half of what you pay in five years. Keep in mind, that it's pretty easy to get 25% off MSRP.Some models retain their value a little longer than others, especially diesel pushers. The baby boomers are starting to retire so the RV market will be strong for at least 15 years unless a catastrophe happens. Woody... I'm not giving up regular traveling. I have two cruises booked this year already... one to Barbados, and one from NYC to London on the QM2 (been on before). Then I'll continue on to Hungary.I got interested in motorhome traveling in 1997 when I was traveling in the Yukon and Alaska. I was talking with a couple that were on the trip and they drove their motorhome pulling their Cadillac on a tow dolly. She was kinda of a ""B"" but he was super nice. They traveled all the way from North Carolina to Washington State (Seattle) to start the trip. So, soon after, I subscribed to Motorhome magazine and have been reading ever since.Michaell you have it right, it's the perfect way to travel for some people, especially, if you have dogs. Not many hotels/motels will take them and they are part of the family. I was just talking to my friend yesterday who just purchased a $700,000 motorhome (I'm in the small league).. and he said almost everyone in the Outdoor Resorts where he bought a lot has a dog or two or three!I know there are folks who will never understand... that's OK as it will leave more room for ""US"" in the state parks and nicer RV parks. I will rarely boon dock (dry camp).Smittynyc... One of the most relaxing things is driving slower on the interstate/freeway. When I rented the big A class motorhomes before, I just stayed ""right"" and let people pass. It never seemed to fail, the far right lane moves faster than the HOV lane!!! When you drive slower, you arrive relaxed and not fatigued. Motorhomes really are easy to drive. You have to remember, they are made for 70 plus year old people; they drive like a Cadillac! You see younger and younger people getting into motorhomeing... it's good for bonding with your young kids, it's cheaper than eating out when you have a whole family to feed. It brings people to nature.I really didn't want to try and defend my decision on purchasing... just wanted to say I was trying to keep my CCBA card up to date like Akangl! :P LOLMark156  "

Base MSRP is something like $80K for it, before options.Now, if I could get the 25% off MSRP that Mark is getting and finanace it over 10 years ....One question ... why is it that the interior decor of many motorhomes is so ... what's the word? ... tacky. Loud fabric patterns abound.

The biggest issue is that most hotels won't allow you to leave them alone in the room.Oh, on a semi-CCBA related note, my Saturn is making some bad noises from the front right suspension when I have the steering wheel cranked all the way to the left.

"mark156","January 2007"," Michaell... the motorhome fabrics can be frightening! That's why I'm going with all leather! (solid). The newer upper end motorhomes aren't too bad fabric-wise... but, in the past, I have seen some awful stuff.The sprinter chassis motorhomes are nice, but tight on space. Winnebago and Itasca make a larger version with the sprinter front cap. They just add a box on the back with one slide out... gives a lot more room.Corvette...yes, cruise ships have internet connections... but, I do take time off occasionally. I have a couple of good people to back me up.Grandtotal... I have not argued the fact that motorhomes depreciate, I think that is well known. It's just like every expensive vacation (try and get your money back on that!), expensive piece of furniture, that big screen plasma tv (remember they were $20,000 at one time) and yachts. Not everything needs an investment return schedule. :surprise: Life is short, death is long... enjoy! Mark  "

"blckislandguy","January 2007"," Right you are, ""not everything needs an investment return schedule."" Having said that, we can certainly look at alternatives to how we are going to rip through 400-600K. In my case whenever I see a late middle age guy and the missuz (this is always the demographic) driving down the turnpike in a truck/bus chassis RV all by their lonesome,I wonder. Whats with these people? Why are they putting themselves through this? Wouldn't they be a lot happier if they just took all that money, bought a new Mercedes sedan and made reservations all across the North America at the very best hotels, say the Ritz? Certainly, it would be cheaper, they would meet a better class of people, and have more freedom to come and go as they pleased. If they had to really pretend that they were diesel truckers they could even buy an E Class Mercedes with the new diesel.Sign me up for 365 nights at various Ritz locations instead of blowing 600K on a bus and an (unpaid) bus driver's job.

"mark156","January 2007"," Blckislandguy, you right about Trump...if it wasn't for his Dad bailing him out...he would have been ""Fired"" years ago.A better example would be Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, etc, etc.... They have plenty of money, are attractive, but really don't have much class in my opinion. So, inferring that people in RV parks have ""less class"" is incorrect.Remember when Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie were in ""It's a simple life""? They traveled the country in a GM Truck pulling an Airstream trailer. The Airstream trailer was for sale at an Airstream dealer in Irvine, CA, as I had seen it on their website. It was near where I rented motorhomes so I stopped by to see it but it wasn't there. As I recall, they were asking a normal used price for it.Back to the motorhome lifestyle, I guess I don't understand why you don't get it. When motorhome traveling, you are in your own cocoon and you don't have to pack and unpack as you would moving from hotel to hotel. Your have your own kitchen to prepare your own food or you can eat out. Everyday, you can have a new view out your window whether you are in a big city or way out in the country.Also, I really enjoy driving. I find class A motorhomes easy to drive and handle.Sometimes, in smaller towns, there are not really great hotels to pick from. I drive across country several times a year and I've been caught having to accept a ""lower grade"" hotel because that was all that was available. Sometimes, you don't know when or where you will be stopping and have to take what's there. In a motorhome, your level of luxury is right there whether you are in a Crackle Barrel parking lot or a Outdoor Resorts RV park. Just close the curtains and you are in your mini luxury suite.I plan on going to Yellowstone National Park this summer and maybe swing through Lake Tahoe... I will hit all 48 states before the motorhome is sold (maybe about five years). Rough estimation is that a $331,000 MSRP motorhome (minus 25% purchase price) will retail for about $90-100K (depending on mileage and condition).For a dingy, a Jeep Liberty is popping to the top of the list because I know Jeep's have the lever to disengage the drive-train. I will just need to have the towbar installed once I purchase it.Happy Travels... Mark156  "

These might be below your price range at this point though, and finding a good example might be challenging. "

"woodyww","January 2007"," The rear hatch on my 6 y.o. bmw 5-series failed tonight for about the 3rd time in 2 years (ironic, because one of the main reasons I bought the car was to have a wagon with a rear hatch). And It's probably dumb to complain about it because it's one of the only things ever to fail on the car (knock wood). It seems to cost about $200 to fix it each time, not bad, but also I think I'm looking for an excuse to sell it.I'm thinking--get something bigger, with more headroom & cargo space--& 4wd or AWD for snow. Japanese this time instead of German or British. And a budget of hopefully under $30K. Only cars I can come up with are a used 4runner or MDX (w/o going nuts & buying a used Land Cruiser or LX470, altho I'd really like one). I've kinda ruled out cute-utes. I'm keeping a new Tacoma on the list (altho less practical for me than a SUV), & possibly a Subaru Outback turbo wagon (which is not bigger than a 5 series of course).Any ideas from anyone?

Totally off-topic, but since you know more about audio stuff than I do, are you using external speakers with your iMac, and if so, which ones did you choose? "
"woodyww","January 2007"," Thanks to everyone for all the suggestions. I'll add the Pilot to my list. I'm pretty sure the 4Runner has more cargo space than an E39 wagon(?). Altho I'd have to look up the 4Runner info. again to be sure.One of the main things I don't like about the bmw wagon is a combination of the low ride height, & the short distance between the seats & roof, or between the load floor & roof. Just feels slightly claustrophobic inside, & I notice it when trying to load lots of stuff or my bike etc. (The rear hatch release breaking occasionally doesn't help loading stuff either).Today I had myself convinced to buy a V6 AWD Rav4. Buying new can be much easier than buying used IMO. I'd have to resign myself to the ""cute-ute"" look, but the power of the V6, the price, etc. could sway me.....I guess I could look at used ""certified"" X5's, but they certainly wouldn't be more reliable than a 5-series.....Any great lease options could sway me too.....

He couldn't have driven it any distance without being in pain. However the MDX did not have this same issue. They both have pros and cons, there were things I liked about the Pilot and things I liked about the MDX. I would have chosen the MDX over the Pilot due to legroom, other than that it would have been the Pilot hands down.I still sometimes wish I had bought the MDX, but I like my 1-ton truck and am pretty much committed to having a 1-ton with the horse trailer I have now.

"corvette","January 2007"," The Pilot is about a foot longer than the Rav4, but offers a usable third row. I never got around to driving the Rav4. BMWs tend to ride quite low to the ground, especially if you have the sport suspension, and the painted bumper on mine is something like 4"" off the ground. The Audi (also with sport suspension) rides a lot softer, and the ground clearance is noticeably higher, plus the lowest part on the front end is black plastic instead of painted, so it won't look terrible even if it scrapes something. Thanks for the heads-up... I don't really have room for a pro audio system in my room (shared house with two other roommates), but once I get my own place, I'll look into it. I have a set of Cambridge Soundworks powered speakers now, which have gotten good reviews, but they've always had a problem where you can (faintly) hear radio transmissions when you're not playing anything through them, especially at night...

"guss","January 2007"," My ignorance on RV's is showing here, but will you be able to do laundry while you are driving ? If that's the case I could see getting one for my daily commute just to get the laundry done. Since this is the car buying forum, I need some advise on getting a second car as a toy. I kinda stumbled across a Toyota Spyder with very low miles for sale relatively cheap. I am just weighing the pros and con of a third car with 2 drivers in the family.The main drawback is having to give up my garage space now that it's 20 degrees out now. The way our driveway is setup there would not be any other place to park it. In the garage it would be subjected to kids bikes and toys possibly scratching it though.I know alot of you have second cars, so I guess my question is it worth it ? Not so much in terms of money, but more the inconvenience. "

Other than all that, I recommend it highly...  "

Too bad they don't offer the option of purchasing a third parking spot. Maybe I'll talk to my neighbors with only one car.... "

"mark156","January 2007"," An entertainment package usually refers to a TV and stereo system in one of the storage bays for outside enjoyment while sitting under the awning.The cool thing about how this one is set up, is that the TV is situated behind the sofa that is located behind the co-pilot seat. When the slide-out is opened, you can hit a button and a flat screen TV comes down and you have a 32 inch TV outside. This was designed as not to take up bay storage space. There is a small ""credenza"" behind the sofa where the TV is stored which is about 4 inches wide and runs the length of the sofa. There is a 32 inch HD flat screen TV above the windshield and a 26 inch flat screen in the bedroom. Another cool feature is that there is a ""see vision coach monitoring system"". As you may know, RV's have rear camera's for backing up, this one has the side camera's for lane changes. When the turning indicator is activated, that ""camera"" will come on so you can see down the side of the coach. Inside the coach where the rear view mirror would be is a small round smoke glassed dome (about the size of a coffee cup). This is part of the ""see vision system. If I'm in the bedroom and hear a noise in the coach (let's say my nieces and nephews are sleeping up front) I can turn on the small screen by the bed and monitor the inside of the coach. This system will also activate all of the outside camera's to monitor what is going on outside.It' also has three mirrors on each BIG side rear view mirror that are electrically adjustable separately.

"michaellno","January 2007"," I was painfully reminded how much of a hassle it is to have more cars than drivers at your house this past month.As most of you know, I inherited my FIL's '92 Subaru late last year after he passed away. The plan is to fix it up and give it to my son in CA this June, so for now it sits at my house.Over Christmas both my step-daughter and step-son were in town visiting, so they both had their cars at home. Plus, the two that my wife and I drive daily. Theis means we now have 5 cars at our house, albeit temporarily.The week before Christmas, we get 26"" of snow. There goes all the on-street parking - after everyone shoveled out their driveway and sidewalk and the city did their plowing, there was no room on the street. Snow was piled probably 3' high.What to do?Well, the cars that got driven the least found there way into the garage - the Subaru and my daughter's ION. That meant that both mine and my wife's car were in the driveway, and my son's car was behind one of them.The following week, we get another 16"" of snow. So, we have to dig out all the cars in the driveway (again), and jockey around vehicles so the right cars are in the right place.The week after that - fortunately, my son returned to Utah so we ""only"" had 4 cars to deal with - we got another 8"" of snow. Again with the digging and repositioning.Finally, my daughter and her friends got bored enough one night after that 3rd storm that they dug out a spot on the street for the Subaru. Hurray! We now only have 3 cars to jockey around in the garage and driveway.My daughter has since returned to school so my car reclaimed its garage spot and the Subaru stays on the street. We got another 9"" of snow this past weekend, so I'll have to dig it out if I want to drive it.I'm thinking that a 3 car garage may be a mandatory feature in the next house that I buy. That way, if I ever do get myself a weekend toy, it will have it's own spot.Mark: enjoy the new RV! If the average new car purchase is something like $26K, then you qualify for a minimum of a dozen punches on your CCBA punch card. You oughta be able to get that tow vehicle for free! "

"woodyww","January 2007"," I like the Subaru idea, the ""vibe"". I've never driven one I really liked, but I haven't driven a new model in maybe 8 years. And in the metro-boston area, you don't see as many as you might assume. In my Yuppie neighborhood, it's mainly hondas & Highlanders.I read the Edmunds review on the current Outback, & the owner's reviews. Kind of mixed reviews--some people loved 'em, others complained about the auto. trans., or repairs needed. Still, the AWD could sway me. There is $750 Cash back on Outbacks right now, but paying over $30K for a New Subie (even a loaded one) somehow doesn't compute for me. I get the impression tho that loaded ones depreciate quite a bit in the 1st year--if I see a great deal on a slightly used one I'd certainly consider it. I'm still thinking of used 4runners--but there are so many advertised online it's almost too confusing. The Taco idea is still in the mix--probably the least practical, esp. considering the length of the vehicle-- ext. cab, for parking, but I love the idea of just buying something New that has great resale. (I wonder how the resale of the Rav4 compares?).Shopping for used (Cars) has started to give me a Headache, & I never thought I'd say that. At least buying New, you know the dealer cost, etc. upfront..... "

"akangl","January 2007"," My truck is having an issue with the interior lights and both the dealer and Chrysler say its because of the timer for the lights which happens to be located IN the instrument cluster. So, in order to fix it they have to replace the cluster, which of course means the odometer too.Now the question is do I just live with the way it is, meaning basically no interior lights for more than 10 seconds at a time. Or do I let them replace the cluster?My concern is that this will hurt the value of the truck since the odometer will be replaced.They told me that what Chrysler does is down the vehicle, meaning it sits locked on the dealer's lot and then they enter the current mileage on the cluster (odo) that they are sending. That way it reads correct mileage. However, won't this still hurt the value? I'm inclined to just live with this issue rather than risk replacing the cluster/odometer.What say you all? Am I worrying for nothing? :sick: "
"stickguy","January 2007"," I thought that the odo display was controlled in the ECU these days, so it shouldn't matter that the cluster was replaced? I had to have the one in my '96 Voyager replaced (the lights kept going spastic), and I don't remember any issue or sticker, and the mileage stayed the same. The dealer that I traded it into didn't care either.If the mileage is going to read the same, what's the difference? Besides, with the way you roll up miles, do you think anyone is going to suspect you of rolling it back? "
"mark156","January 2007"," Akangl, something similar happened to me on my 2000 Mercedes E430. The digital clock that is located in the instrument cluster would lose about a minute or two a month. So, the dealer ordered a new instrument cluster and I set up an appointment. A few days later my service advisor called me and told me to drop the car off. I did and a few hours later he realized that the wrong cluster was ordered, he apologized and I made an appointment for the next week.The new cluster came in and I dropped the car off. My car had just turned 10,000 miles at that time (currently 34,700). When I picked the car up, it had 9,800 miles on it. They had written down the mileage from the previous week's visit. So, I got to see my car change to 10,000 miles twice! LOL!Didn't bother me in the least as it was all done by the dealer and I don't think it would effect the value at all. I've had the car just over 8 years and it still looks like new as I keep it garaged, washed and [non-permissible content removed]-and-span clean!Mark PS. I have an appointment at 10:00 today to close the deal on the motorhome!! YEAH!!! :shades: "
"woodyww","January 2007"," If what they're saying is true, that: meaning it sits locked on the dealer's lot and then they enter the current mileage on the cluster (odo) that they are sending,Then I can't think of a reason it would hurt the value. With an older mechanical OD, they wouldn't or couldn't reset the new OD, & then you'd get a sticker on the door-sill indicating the mileage when the OD was replaced, which could lead to a TMU title when the vehicle is sold. I'd just grill the dealer more on whether they report it to your state RMV, or if it somehow shows up on a carfax. As long as the vehicle doesn't end up with a TMU title down the road, you should be fine. "
"woodyww","January 2007"," Thanks for the tip on the 4Runner seats-- seats are really important. I have to say my 5-series is THE most comfortable car on road trips I've ever owned.

My trying to go Japanese, at least with the vehicles I've mentioned, may be unrealistic, in the sense that after owning 2 bmw's, a saab turbo, & a Range Rover, I may just be too ""spoiled"".....OTOH, I still want to check out the Rav4 more--I think I've read comments that the seats are pretty good? I priced a Sport AWD V6 with Moonroof--invoice is $25,209. Has 18"" wheels, ""fender flares"", & I think it looks better than the Limited--more ""hunky"" with the larger rims.

YBMV. (Your Back May Vary)My fruitless search for something older to buy continues - why is it nothing has caught my fancy yet? Seems like this used to be easier...and has anyone noticed that cars today don't seem to be as well taken care of as they used to? I blame this on lengthened maintenance schedules and improved reliability: 20 years ago if you didn't maintain the car frequently, you had good odds of ending up on the side of the road before too long. Nowadays people just ignore all the maintenance because they can. The only thing that seems to still be in Joe Average's consciousness is those oil changes.

But I have a feeling the nostalgia would wear off pretty quickly and leave me with a car that would likely be hard to unload.I would love to find a well-loved Celica or Supra from that era, or an older 4-cyl pick-up in decent shape. So far, nuttin' doin'.Oh, and vis-a-vis the '96 Accord, I love the styling but my personal rule is to pass up all the cars with the crappy aftermarket tints (which by the age of 10 years or more are beginning to bubble, crack, look like junk, are usually too dark, shall I go on?).:-/ "

"growwise","January 2007"," I checked out autotrader for used cars and found 03 Acura 3.2 TL, 02-03 Infinit I35 and 03 Nissan Maxima GLE tempting. However, one quick look at those model forums, I'm a bit scared by transmission troubles (3.2TL) and maf sensor issues (max). So, I wondered how about a compact sedan for same price? like a brand new versa sedan. Sure.. it wont have the leather, moon roof, brushed aluminium/wood, bose stereo etc.. but you do get peace of mind with brand new and only maintenance for some time would be just oil changes.So off I went to a few dealers near my place last night. Checked out the following:1. Hyundai Elantra GL Comfort Auto2. Nissan Versa sedan 1.8S3. Nissan Sentra4. Honda Civic LXThey all are new designs and are economical to own. Resale wise, civic wins hands down while versa/elantra not so sure. Elantra surprised me a lot. Its light years ahead of previous models. Very nice execution.At nissan dealer, Versa impressed me the most. Its based on Renault megane and the greenhouse is tall (tons of head room front and back) and seats are raised so rear passengers have more foot room. But I thought the sedan version of versa was an afterthought (felt like a hatchback with trunk sticking out). Sentra was meh.. why bother.. nothing outstanding about it.While I was at Honda dealer, I also checked out if there were any new deals on Accord SE. Not a whole lot.. considering that this is the last model year run. Redesigned 08 Accord is supposed to bow in november or so. But salesman winked at me and said he could do sumthin on 07s..Even though its more expensive, resale of accords are good so I am adding that to my list as well. Then I figured if I'm gonna go over my budget by considering Accord, why not add Camry to the list as well since that is a bit wider and has a comfy ride. Also, camry has lower front overhang compared to accord. Accord's engine bay had a lot of unutilized space with the fourbanger. So tight turn ins and wiggling in/out of parking spots is easier in say civic or even camry. I might be wrong and still its not a deal breaker.So, my shopping seem to be all over the place.. from used pseudo luxury cars to compacts and midsize. I need to get my head examined for becoming so indecisive. Anyways, thinking April/May timeframe would be a good time to pull the trigger. Galaxy grey Civic LX might just fit my needs but then there's that Accord SE in Carbon Bronze pearl calling me. And then there's the practical side which says that 03 Maxima GLE might be sensible... Aaargh why's car shopping becoming such a head ache? "
"zodiac2004","January 2007"," I highly recommend an 04 Acura TL. Shop around - there should be a glut of lease returns in the market.BTW any of the 3 used cars you have mentioned are head and shoulders above the used compacts you can buy for the same price.I know that the Acura transmission issues affected a very small number of cars - and were probably taken care of by 03.But salesman winked at me and said he could do sumthin on 07sThere is a reason for that. Most people think the 06 and 07 Accord sedans look hideous, IMHO. An 03 Accord EX has all the goodies and is a lot of car for the money. You can add that to your list of used cars. "

"andre1969","January 2007"," Hmmm, I saw an '83-84 Camry hatchback this morning at work. It was pretty rusty and had exhaust problems. When I heard the loud rumble I was expecting a much bigger car, and was a bit shocked to find out it was coming from this Camry!I remember sitting in a first-gen Camry at the local junkyard once. They had just gotten it in, and it hadn't been picked at yet. I was pretty impressed, actually. For a car that really wasn't that big on the outside, I fit just fine, both front and back. How they managed that kind of space-efficiency and comfort from something that small, I'll never know. I don't think they know, either, because today they seem to have taken some cues from 1970's Detroit, making the things bigger and fatter, but not necessarily roomier. "

What about a New Civic--it's almost a ""no brainer"" in it's class. If a new Accord, I'd say wait until summer to see if they have any great deals. Or, wait until the new model Accord comes out.PS: what are the prices on the cars you mentioned? "
"growwise","January 2007"," Prices are in CAD so they will seem rather high than USD.New cars: (MSRPs are higher but prices are given by salesmen)Sonata - 22k low end model 0% @ 60Elantra - 19k (loaded) 2.9% 60 monthsCivic - 20k LX 4.9% 60 Versa - 17k sedan 4.9% 60 Accord - 25k 3.9% @ 60Camry - 25k (Accord has moon roof and alloy wheels but not camry) 5.9%? not sureUsed cars:03 Maxima - 14.5K loaded 88k km - less than 60k mi03 3.2TL - 16k loaded - around 60k miFinancing rate on used cars is at 8%My firstborn will arive (keeping fingers crossed) around April/May and my inlaws will be in town.

"andre1969","January 2007"," with regards to using a car seat, but I found the Elantra and the latest Civic surprisingly roomy inside. I'm 6'3"", yet had no trouble fitting in the back seat of either one, and that's with the front seat all the way back!Of those new choices though, I think I like the Accord the best. I like it better than the Camry, and while I want to like the Sonata, I think I'd just trust the Accord more. Plus, the improved resale value. "
"growwise","January 2007"," There's no LX in canada. DX-G is probably more like it. SE is a step up with moonroof, alloys etc.. So its probably like 6k more than civic LX. SE is 1700 bucks more than DX-G and salesman convinced me that moonroof and alloys for 1700 bucks is a good deal. There could be other minor differences.. didnt look too carefully.I know it doesnt make sense comparing a used lux car with a new compact and then throwing a new midsize into the mix. But resale is high on accords and finance rate and rebate might justify the difference. Have to first get rid of my car which is becoming a major pain in the neck. Have to do private sale. There are some issues with it as well (not powertrain wise but the rest). My first major indecision came about deciding how long to keep it. It took an idiot light and some annoying noises to make up my mind. Besides, arrival of my first child is a perfect opportunity to convince the missus  "
"corvette","January 2007"," Not sure what the MAF issue is on a Maxima, but I remember from reading the VeeDub boards that it was a common failure with VWs as well. I don't think it's a major repair, and the newer parts are probably more failure-resistant if it's a widespread problem. Allegedly, the failures occur more often with cars that have aftermarket oiled gauze air filters. The TL is probably more of a ""driver's"" car. I like cars with leather and sunroofs, so I'd probably lean towards a clean used one. It looks like your payments would be less, so that should help offset any unexpected repairs. "
"qbrozen","January 2007"," I know the TL tranny issue was blown up to more than it should have been ... but it is an issue that would worry me, nonetheless. "
"corvette","January 2007"," Yeah, I'd worry more about a potential transmission failure than a potential MAF replacment, but I'd factor it somewhat into the price I'd be willing to pay for the car. Also, other than the small potential of a premature transmission failure, everything else on the Acura will probably be as tough as nails. "

Even with the fantastic reliability of the Honda and Acura brand, there are hard reasons for new..... and it involves the new car smell!The last used car I ever bought was meticulously cleaned by the previous owner. This isn't unusual of course, but I noted a scent that was pleasant, but seemed fake. I asked the seller if he ever smoked in the car and was trying to cover up the smell. He triumphantly pulled out the lighter and the coils were completely clean. In a matter of time, the car once again revealed its true odor, and it involved heavy smoking. We lived in a small town, and I found out later, the seller had merely plucked a lighter from the salvage yard and replaced the original lighter, quite a common trick as it turns out. He was an individual that loved new cars, but his two addictions required shafty means to get the best price for the car he was selling.That was the last used car I ever bought! The problem with used cars is that there is ALWAYS something wrong with it and the seller will ALWAYS have something they don't reveal to you. "

The VW cost factor for repairs in the second half of the car's lifespan has me having second thoughts on this one, big-time, but it is claimed to be a one-owner with good care and full maintenance records, and it is in that electric blue they had for the K2s, which I really like. Oh, I hope one of these works out. I need to scratch the itch - it has now been a whole year since I bought a car. :-(And BTW, I am keeping it very much in mind that a stick shift Lexus will be virtually impossible to resell if I have it a little while and it loses my fancy.

"corvette","January 2007"," Just some random musings from the Louisville auto show on Saturday. There was a very high turnout--admission was free, and there was also a boat show going on in another wing of the expo center. And, there was a U of L game later that night. I was on a pretty tight deadline and didn't get to spend as long as I would have liked, but still managed to see most of the recently-redesigned vehicles. Chrysler Aspen: The metallic white model they had on display had a pretty bad case of orange peel paint. Ford Explorer: Embarassingly cheap interior. The Edge is better in this respect. GMC Acadia / Saturn Outlook: Overall, I was impressed. The black plastic cladding at the bottom is very noticeable in person, but is functional as far as preventing scratches and providing for easier cleanup. The black wart antenna on GM's vehicles with OnStar is very unattractive (and usually not centered on the body). The interior was nice and the third row would be tolerable for an adult for a short trip--or comfortable for a child for a long trip. Passenger space (in person, not just going by the numbers) is as good as the regular length Yukon. Ford Mustang: Manual shifter seemed balky. Not sure I could live with it as a daily driver. Civic Si: Manual shifter was very crisp. Looks like a nice car, shame about that spoiler on the trunk. BMW X5: In person, looks almost exactly like the old X5. At first, I wasn't sure if it was the new one or not. Useless third row seat. The FJ Cruiser takes the cake for having blind spots that are downright scary--and the design of the rear windows in the cabin makes the blind spot look smaller than it is, at least on the driver's side. The new Tundra extended-cab looks pretty bad in that department as well. "

"mark156","January 2007"," Stopped by the car lots yesterday and the day before to check out a 'dingy' car for the new motorhome. The top contenders are the Jeep Liberty and the Honda CRV. Saturday, I checked out the Liberty and it seems just fine for what I will need it for. I have been to this local dealer for service when I had my 1996 and 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee's (never bought there). One of the major turn-off's was that EVERY vehicle on the lot back in 1999-2002 (when I owned my last Jeep) had the addendum sticker on the window. I mean EVERY car had one (even Neon's) marking it up at least $2,500 with ""market adjustment"" listed as the reason.Well, they apparently have had enough flack about it as not one car had it on the sticker. A nice Liberty Limited with sunroof, leather and 4x4 will run about $27,000 list. They didn't have any 4x4's on the lot but expect some to come in soon.Sunday, I stopped by the high volume Honda store to look at the new CRV. As I drive up in my Land Rover, there are 5 salesman standing there licking their chops. I can not stand that! I park and a young guy comes over to introduce himself, etc. etc... must have 20 yrs old tops.I told him that I was interested in the new CRV and he had several opened in front for customers to see. One was a base model and the other was top of the line with leather (no Nav---will come out later). Right next to the MSRP sticker is an addendum sticker which includes (hope I can remember them all)... Chrome wheels, etched glass, fabric protectant, wheel locks, etc. EVERY new CRV had this which was about $4,400 added to the sticker. That is such a TURN OFF!I told the guy, ""what is this"", ""I don't want all the stuff on there""... he said, ""we can work with that"". :mad: As I was looking at the CRV with leather, he runs in the showroom and comes out with keys but pulls out another CRV for me to look at. He really wanted me to drive it but I said no that I'm just in the looking stages now. With the 'added features', the CRV listed just shy of $30,000. My main attraction to the Jeep is that the drivetrain can be totally disengaged with a lever. Whereas, the Honda will be in neutral but the AWD will be engaged.I have time to make up my mind as the motorhome won't be off the assembly line until early March.Mark156  "
"corvette","January 2007"," The NAV models of the CR-V are available now. Most of the dealers around here put about $1,000 in accessories on them.

"perna","January 2007"," Not sure if you've chosen between '03 TL, Max, or I35 yet.I can tell you that my '03 Max rides and drives like the day I drove it off the lot. I've owned the car for 4 years now, and it is ageless. I live in Michigan, junky roads and all, so it's somewhat of a surprise to have a four year old ANYTHING with no squeaks or rattles. The car is a rocket, too. It is strong from 0-whatever, and isn't a revvy engine like the TL's. If you like winding a car up to 7k RPM and listening to it scream, you're better off with the TL. The Max's engine is much more subtle, but will propel you to ridiculous speeds regardless if you're at a dead stop or already going 80 mph. The I35, as I'm sure you know, is the Max's twin. It is much softer sprung, though, so it just depends what you're looking for. The one nice thing about '03 I35s is that some of them are wired for factory satellite radio (I think it has to have NAV); you can buy a $200-$300 OEM Nissan kit from eBay and be up and running. The Maximas from that era didn't have that capability. The MAF issue is caused, I believe, by those aftermarket air filters whose name I can't recall but I think it starts with a ""K"". The filter is dipped in oil and cleaned every so often. Bad, bad, bad. The only real flaw with the car is the Bose head unit, but I blame Clarion more than Bose or Nissan. If you can find one with the ""normal"" single CD player, those are more desirable than the 6-disc Bose changer units. The Bose uses its own amp, and special wiring/speakers, so if you want to upgrade you pretty much have to rip the whole thing out and start from scratch. You CAN buy a Scosche unit for $30 or so that will allow you to use an aftermarket unit with the Bose amp/speakers/wiring, but I've heard that they're not that great. All in all, my Max is such a good car it cured my CCB'ing. Paid it off last month, and plan on keeping it for years to come. "

Probably because they seem like a really good deal even at list price.Personally, if I go into a weird (or any type of) dealership to look at cars, if it's easy to take a test drive, I do it.

There is refinement and thats a compliment for a last year model. However, its not whisper quiet. You can hear road noise, engine noise etc.. Overall its a nice car especially in carbon bronze pearl. Walked out of the dealership with details. I bet they can do a little better but that requires me signing my life away then and there. I still got couple months to see how the apr pans out. You know its kinda weird how hesitant I've become. My last car purchase was just walking into a dealership at lunch hour just for kicks and walking out with brand new. Now I'm dilly dallying a lot. Doesnt mean that I matured financially that much either. I took a 10 grand worth of family vacation last year. :surprise: "

"corvette","January 2007"," The amount of BS & game-playing I've gotten at the one nearest me is a real drag. After reading a lot of other peoples' experiences, I feel fortunate that the Honda dealer nearest my hometown doesn't do any of this. Yes, they won't really discount a hot model, but they will also sell a less-hot model at invoice, and they only preinstall accessories on their demonstrator models. I may not be in their target demographic, and I've never bought anything from them, but like a good realtor or accountant, it's a good thing to have in your address book. "
"boomchek","January 2007"," Yeah, there isn't much room to play with in the Accord.Our most popular models are the SE and EXL, and I predict those will sell out first.Plus there is no honda support money coming in on them at the moment (at least in Western Canada) so you do have a little less than $2k in the car. Not sure if they'll sell them at invoice though as we're definetly not. "
"perna","January 2007"," How much more is a New TL? Or new Maxima vs '03? Twice as much as an '03 maybe? You were looking at new Civic-size cars also I think? What about a New Civic or Accord instead of used TL or Maxima? I know, not quite as nice, but you might really like a new Honda. New Maximas and TLs are hideously expensive, but you do get what you pay for (at least with the Max, haven't really had enough seat time in a TL). The Max ages so much better than the VW or GM vehicles I've owned, it really does end up being a wash since at least in my case I'm going to keep the car a LOT longer than I did any previous vehicle. That said, you will be able to STEAL new Maximas next year. The '09/'10 will be a completely new model. This is basically what I did with my '03; I bought it in late Feb of '03, when '04s were literally days away from hitting. I had to do zero negotiation, and I even remember the salesguy saying, ""This is our absolute, bottom barrel price. My manager completely dropped his pants on this car, because the '04s are basically here."" And judging from what I knew from Edmunds and elsewhere online, they actually came in a grand less than I had planned on paying. That said, stay away from the showroom if you're thinking about a new Max. The '07s are really, really, really, REALLY nice. I saw the '04s-'06s as being nice, but flawed cars. The 2007 is perfect, though. "

They have raised BS & game-playing to a high art. I was on the verge of buying a new Acura a few times over the years, but just couldn't deal with all of their hassles. (They're truly amazing, like some of the salesmen in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"").Closer to home, there's a pretty good Toyota dealer a few miles from me. They almost never seem weird, & were giving me great ""internet pricing"" on RAV4's last I checked. Ditto with a more rural Toyota dealer about 20 miles from me. (I'm sure there are some sleazy toyota dealers tho).Partly why I still have a couple of Toyotas on my list--RAV4 awd v6, probably a Sport, but I still can't shake the Taco fetish: I'd get an Access Cab V6 4x4, w/either TRD sport or TRD off-road package.

With a stick, of course. I had one of these before, and there's a long story there but anyway it was my one and only misguided foray into the miserable world of automatics, and after trying to live with the transmission for 18 months, it got sold. I always missed it though, so I went out and picked up a new one in dark blue. They are a bit more swank these days than they were back in the debut days of early 2002, so my new one has ABS and a 6-disc changer with the tweeter kit, not to mention an IP that's easier to read and makes more use of color than the monotone crimson of the early cars. So, I made it one year and 20 days before I purchased again, and now I think that will be it for a long time. My search over the last few weeks has led me to believe that the time of the beater has come and gone for me - I must be getting old. Half of the sellers didn't even respond, many cars were already sold, and every time I got a line on a car it was way TOO beaten. I figure the only way I might buy anything in the next couple of years is if I get a hand-me-down from family or friends with a bargain price tag.But this is my still my fourth new car and approximately 8th car purchase (including the used ones) in the last 5 years, so I figure my CCBA membership is good for the next two years even without further purchases in that time! ;-) "

We got a E-Class home but the transmission started acting wierd.We've only gotten one 3-series BMW and it was a great drive until the temps hit 15 degrees outside and it wouldn't start.Luckily we still have our Hondas. I just jumped out of the demo 06 18K mile BMW into my 04 54K mile Honda started it right up and left.Hondas are always called appliances. But isn't that what a car IS anyway? A fridge is built to cool stiff, a blender blends, and a washing machine washes. What good is a great driving car if you can't count on it to start and get you where you are going? Would you keep a washing machine that only got your clothes clean part of the time?The few German cars we've had have not changed per perception of them when I was driving cars cross country.

"nippononly","February 2007"," At the time I had the RSX, I also had an old 4Runner. Well, a relative needed a vehicle on the quick and dirty, so I gave him my old truck, intending to buy a new one.

This is the first time in a decade I don't own a 4WD. We'll see how that goes! Oh, and that answers michaell's question: I still have the Echo.

"corvette","February 2007"," The thing that I used to not mind, but now has become a pet peeve, is the prevalent use of matte, silver or gray metallic painted plastic trim. My Altima had this, and although it stayed in decent condition, depending on the auto manufacturer, some of it is very easy to scratch, and some of it wears off very easily. I think the wood kits on the Pilot and CR-V cover it up, though. Either of them have better interiors than the Escape or Explorer. I see a lot of Japanese products, but also see a lot of Suburbans and Expeditions and Escalades... Actually, the only place I remember seeing a glut of Japanese products was my last trip to the state capital. About half the cars there were Toyotas (and I don't think that many people working there are from Georgetown). "
"woodyww","February 2007"," I think the Pilot I saw was a previous gen. From the pics I've seen of the current-gen Pilot and CR-V, the interiors, at least with Leather, look very nice.... "
"michaellno","February 2007"," Before I bought my L300, I took a close look at the Altima. This was in the fall of 2002, not long after they had been released. As much as I liked the exterior, I was really put off by the look of the interior - to me, it just seemed cheap. And, I didn't much care for the orange dash lighting.With the L300, it was pretty much the opposite - the exterior styling was not as fresh as the Altima (and this was the new for 2003 'reskin' of the L300), but the interior was much nicer. I figured that I would spend more time inside the car rather than outside, so that was a big part of my decision making process.(And, yes, the L300 also has silver painted plastic pieces on the center console.)I have to admit that I've been paying much closer attention to the interiors of the cars I've sat in lately. The new Saturn Aura has a nice interior, especially with the brown leather. However, there are still some cheap pieces, particularly the arm rests.OTOH, the Volvos that I sat in a couple of months ago really impressed me -- even the S40 and V50 have a more 'upscale' look and feel to them, and they are based on the same platform as the Mazda 3 and the European Focus. The XC90 was downright opulent.When that time comes to get a new car, you can bet that this will be an item high on my priority list. "
"british_rover","February 2007"," The Swedes have always made some of the best interior and most comfortable feeling seats IMO.They make lousy cup holders though just like the germans. "
"michaellno","February 2007"," Funny you should mention cupholders .. for my wife, having a good set of cupholders is a huge issue to her.For example, the cupholders in the center console of her VUE are down around the floor ... she can put a 20oz bottle of water in there and know that it won't tip over or otherwise dislodge. Also, it's a good place for her to put her purse.However, in the latest incarnation of the VUE, GM redesigned the center console area so that the cupholders are more at arm level. Not nearly as nice for purses or bottled water, so sayeth the spouse.Funny what's important to folks when they buy a car!And, I agree with you completely on the seats in a Volvo. I've always read about them in the magazines, but until you've sat in them ....The quick test drive I had in the V50 revealed some pretty comfortable front chairs. I had sat in the previous generation S40 (the one with the 1.9L turbo engine) and found it to be quite cramped for me. I had plenty of room in the V50, by comparison.But, I'm not in the market for a new car anytime soon ... so I guess it doesn't really matter. "
"british_rover","February 2007"," One of the wholesalers that works for us tries to always drive a XC70 when he can because of how comfortable the seats are.He can drive hundreds of miles in a week using that car and still feel refreshed.He also likes them because they can decent gas mileage yet still have some power and if he needs to drive over a curb or drive in unprepared lots the extra ground clearnce helps.

I'm planning on a factory delivery but I noticed there is a charge for factory delivery of $1,500. I email my salesman and ask why since I'm picking it up at the factory? He says whether you take a factory delivery or a dealership delivery, it covers the cost of explaining the total works of the motorhome with access to 1 or 2 technicians for 2 days. It also covers a full tank of diesel (150 gallons). So, if fuel is running about $3.00 a gallon in April (my p/u time), $3.00 x 150 gallons = $450. Since I'm getting a ""percent"" discount on MSRP... that would leave about $720 for their services. :surprise: This unit does have a lot of ""components"" so it may very well take two days for me to understand everything.Mark156 "

Even if it's the Candian Integra, which I understand is as much four-door U.S. Civic as it is Integra, $4500 for a 75K 2000 Civic LX (not a straight comparison, but roughly the same in value I would imagine) isn't too bad a price. Certainly not getting hosed at that price, with only 75K miles. In my neck of the woods, such a Civic would retail at about $7000 US. Subtract at least $500 if it doesn't have A/C, which would also make it infinitely more difficult to sell here in California. "

Those Civics hold their value well. An Integra LS, MY 2000, 75K miles, in good condition, would be worth around $8000 retail, I should think, so an actual transaction price of $6400 US again doesn't seem like an awful deal to me.

"dad23","February 2007"," Sounds like it could have worked like that...saw this yesterday:ATHENS, Ohio (AP) - A college student who reported that his car was stolen got a surprise when he learned a woman had mistaken it for her daughter's car and taken it - using her key. Kate Anderson of Athens became an accidental car thief when she went to pick up her daughter's car near an Ohio University building last week. Anderson spotted the nickel-gray Toyota Camry and used her daughter's key to unlock the car, start the engine and drive home- without realizing that the car wasn't her daughter's. When Charlie Vansant left class a short time later, he found only an empty parking spot. He first assumed the car, made in the mid-1980s, had been towed, but when police couldn't find a record of it, they took a theft report. ""I thought it was very, very bizarre,"" he said. Toyota spokesman Bill Kwong said key technology wasn't as sophisticated two decades ago, and there were only so many ways to cut a key, making it possible for such a mix-up to occur. He said the company now has a microchip embedded in the keys for 90 percent of its vehicles that allows them to start only with the correct key. The morning after Anderson took the car, her daughter discovered the Camry in the driveway wasn't hers. Anderson said she was able to find Vansant's name on paperwork in the glove compartment and look up his phone number on the Web site for the university in this southeast Ohio city. When Anderson told Vansant the car was in her driveway, ""It sounded real fishy at first, like maybe she wanted to hold the thing for ransom,"" Vansant said. He eventually went to the house with a police officer, where he was reunited with his car. According to a police report, the case was closed ""because of mistaken car identity."" Anderson wasn't charged. Vansant seemed to blame the car company more than the ""thief.""""Her key fit not only my lock, but my ignition as well- so high-five for Toyota, I guess,"" he said. "

I'm glad I got it at the other dealer since the buying experience was awesome. Frankly, it was not about money solely. Its the feeling you need to get to be satisfied at the second stage of the process. First stage is obviously the vehicle. I was treated well and deal was fair. No wrangling and the guy was a jolly good fella. :shades: I got 3 grand for my trade-in and 1250 off the msrp. They also threw in a free oil change and couple t-shirts.

Statesides, it was 6% sales tax the last I checked.Anyways, these are fresh off the boat from Japan and the supply seems to be tight. So, its going to take couple weeks. As soon as the vehicle hits vancouver, the dealer needs to grab it and put it on a train to toronto and unload it from a truck.

Other than a $4K 'regional' adjustment for the MazdaSpeed3 (which took the asking price to north of $30K!), I didn't see too much that surprised me.Over the weekend, the wife give me the go ahead to get a new car if I wanted ... we'd been thinking about a new house, but have put that off for now.At lunch today, I drove a Subaru Outback with a 5 speed. Nice car, lots of features, decent power for a 4 cylinder.Asking price is $24K, I suspect $22K is doable and I've got about $4K in equity in my Saturn.I really don't know if I want to get back onto the payment carousel ..

This is a 5-speed manual model with an MSRP of $24,6xx.Edmunds shows a TMV price of $22,xxx after the $750 rebate.The family already has one AWD vehicle (Saturn VUE), so it's not like I need it.

My thinking is: Subarus have pretty good resale, & pretty good reliability. It sounds like a very ""sensible"" purchase, probably, & might last you for a long time. And Subies have better resale & reliability than a Saturn (I think???). Keeping an older car is not ""always"" more cost efficient, IMO.

(Or, I could just be trying to enable you to buy a new car)....I don't think I'll argue that point.Here in CO, used Subarus go for some pretty stupid money. The '92 Legacy I inherited from my FIL last year could be sold - easily, I suspect - for $2500-3000. And that's with almost 140K on the odometer.The Saturn is probably worth about $8K on trade, which is 1/3 of the original purchase price 4 years ago. The good news is that I owe about $4500.The Saturn only has 56K on it at the moment, so I've got my fingers crossed that nothing major will go wrong anytime soon.

If it was an expensive Euro-car I could understand that, but it's supposed to be an economy car. It's not a good track record for repairs for the Saturn, & it's barely out of warranty. Getting $8k for it towards a brand new Subie w/warranty at around $22K sounds like a No Brainer to me......often people here try to justify wacky reasons to trade cars, that make no economic sense.....IMHO you're actually talking yourself out of a very sensible trade.....Just my 2 cents, cheers, woody "
"michaellno","February 2007"," No, I don't think that you are being overbearing. It's nice to get some feedback.However, with regards to your statement:If it was an expensive Euro-car I could understand thatWell, the L-series is a cousin to both the Cadillac Catera as well as the Vauxhall/Opel Vectra, so it has some Euro-roots. 54-degree V6, for one. Euro-style brakes, for another.That was a big chunk of the $2K last year .. redid the brakes completely .. pads, rotors and calipers. Rotors couldn't be turned, since they are too soft.The other big issue was the BCM, which, I've learned, is a big failure point on the L-series. The issues that I haven't yet run into are the fuel pump (also known to be bad on the L) and the inevitable timing belt replacement. (Ironically, on the 4-cyl versions of the L, it uses a timing chain and lasts much longer).The car is out of warranty, so starting fresh with 3/36 bumper to bumper and 5/60 on the powertrain (standard Subartu warranty) would be nice.But, with only 8 or 9 more payments left, I'm very torn. I really don't want to start up with 4 or 5 years of payments, but, as you point out, I don't really want to be nickeled and dimed to death, either.Anybody else want to offer a thought or two? "

"michaellno","February 2007"," Well, the $2K I spent on the L last year has really been the only non-service money I've spent on it. It currently needs a transmission flush and a tire rotation, but other than that, it's been regular maintenance all the way.Well, unless you want to count the $400 I dropped on new tires a couple of years ago.The L is my first Saturn (since then, we've bought 3 more) and I've been pleased by some aspects of it - the polymer panels still look new even after 4 years - and frustrated by other things - the chrome wheel option was a mistake, given the soft rotors and the amount of brake dust that has accumulated on them.Overall, I'd have to give Saturn a B, maybe a B+. I know it wasn't terribly popular when compared to the Camcord, but it has done everything I've asked it to do up to this point.I guess that's one of the reasons why I'm struggling with the decision to trade it in.Look at it this way - I'd be giving up leather, automatic, the V6 and a sunroof for AWD, an AUX jack for my iPod, a stick shift and the utility of a wagon body style.Other than that, they are pretty similar in options and creature comforts. Heck, even the mileage is about the same - 21/29 for the L, 23/28 for the Outback.I've been given the name of a salesperson who works at a different Subaru store here in Denver who, I've been told, will sell any car for invoice minus incentives.The calculations look something like this:Invoice (w/ accessories) 23071Rebate 750 -----Subtotal 22321Trade in Value 8000 -----Subtotal 14321Tax (7.5%) 1074 -----Subtotal 15395Balance due on Saturn 4600 -----Amount to finance 19995(at least, I think that's how the numbers would look - I believe that's how things were calculated when we traded in the Focus on the ION last summer) "

"growwise","February 2007"," Like I said earlier, I don't expect folks here to try and talk me out of a new car.It depends really.. If you are in a dual income household it probably doesnt matter. If you are in single income type of family, then I would try and talk you out of it. 60k is nothing really. Engines now outlast cars and easily go upto 200k on regular oil and more with synthetic. Just need to get the spark plugs, timing belt and water pump changed every 100k. There will be other problems and carmakers have built some planned annoyances so that on relatively cheap cars, people dont bother fixing them. I tried hard (especially for someone who used to trade in every year) and managed to go upto 115k and more than 5.5 years. But finally the suspension did it for me. Springs are broken and needed replacement along with struts/bushings etc. Engine was still like new. There is the other psychological part which is fear of whatelse can go wrong. Even if something goes wrong, everybody worth their finance 101 salt knows that it is cheaper to fix your ride than replace it. But if you got an itch to scratch, you just found an excuse. One thing I regret was doing the 100k maintenance. All I did was spend big money and sell for cheap. Some dude will reap the benefits.Point is that if you got this far in thinking, it means you want to do something. A few more payments doesnt matter.

It needs tires but is otherwise clean as a pin. Bought it private party - Carmax offered the guy $6500 and I gave him $6800 for it, which I think is a really good price. It's nice to have another 4 door to haul kids around in a pinch, and with a few mild suspension / engine enhancements it'll be a lot of fun at the Mazda club track days.

If you are talking about and early E36, that is a total.An Achilles' heel on the cars is the trailing arm bushings and the shock mounts. As those wear, it allows play and slop in the suspension which beats up those two mounting points. Changing the trailing arm bushings and updating the shock mount supposedly helps a lot.

There are also rumors that the Germans (Daimler) is putting Chryslers up for sale, GM may buy Chryslers or a Chinese Company-Chery Motors ?? No more pensions or security. I am betting it will be the Chinese because GM is hurting right now. I feel utterly compelled to buy North American and you should too. All our jobs will be affected, this will hurt everyone.

Actually, I think the more recent Acura systems (like the last 2 years or so) are my favorites. I have had really good luck with the voice activation, destination entry is a breeze, and the combination of GPS and dead reckoning makes it very accurate. The Toyota system on some vehicles uses a touch screen that its pretty advanced offering tactile feedback. The Prius doesn't have that particular screen but I have found it very easy to use none-the-less. "

"perna","February 2007"," My wife and I are taking delivery of a Chrysler Town and Country either Friday or Monday, depending on how the timing of things work out.It's actually a pretty sharp van; deep blue, and the extra little bit of chrome on the T&C make it stand out.I was surprised how pleasant the van was to drive. The seats are VERY comfortable! She had her heart set on a Saturn Outlook, but really decided in the end that she wants a minivan. With two small children and an obnoxious little Boston Terrorist (Terrier) to tote around, I can't argue. We're also buying it and not leasing, which is why I'm not particularly happy she chose the Chrysler. We need to keep it 8-10 years to get our money's worth out of it thanks to the resale, and she understands that. We're cognizant of the fact that our 5 month old and 3 year old will completely trash the van, despite our best efforts to keep it nice. We don't let the toddler eat in the car except on very long road trips, and even then it's something relatively ""clean"" like a soft granola bar. But, who knows. I just remember my parents' cars were rolling pits of nastiness (mostly thanks to their dual-purpose use of vomitorium/transportation appliance).That said, it will be a 3 year loan. Plus she gets employee pricing through her dad (he's out of the country and we need his pin, hence the wait until Friday), AND Chrysler knocks $4k off the top, so it works out to be a pretty cheap van in the end. About $22k before taxes, and it's fairly well loaded. Power everything, built-in Sirius (which makes us both happy, since we love Sirius and hate XM), those fold flat middle captain's chairs (which really is an engineering marvel, if you've ever had a chance to play with them).

I have to be honest; nearly everyone I know except for my father really don't take good care of their cars. They think that as long as they change the oil once in awhile and put gas into it, they will run forever. I always follow the mfg's recommended service from the manual, and have it done by someone I trust. I have full confidence that if I get the transmission serviced properly, I won't have any problems with it. If we do, I'll fix it, and it will be an unspoken lesson to my wife which makes of cars to look at next time. She already got a good lesson with my Maxima; I've run the thing for nearly 4 years now over rough Michigan roads in stop-n-go traffic.

The profits for foreign companies go back to the mothership- if they run into trouble, workers here will be cut so fast your head will swim. No, US owned companies are stuck here, for better or worse, and if you want to support US automobiles, buying domestic manufacturers is the way to do it. A Camry built in Kentucky is not just as good for this country as a Ford, even a Ford built in Canada or Mexico, is. Personally, I'm not going to buy an American car unless I think it offers something the imports don't, most likely value. But don't fool yourself when you buy an imported car built here. Just being the outsourced assembly plant is not nearly as good as having your HQ, engineering, design and testing in a place, and by far the domestics contribute more to our economy than the imports.

"michaellno","February 2007"," I'm with guss on this, except I'd go for the VUE instead of the CR-V.If all you need is a runabout when you're away from the 'mother ship', the FWD VUE would work well. One advantage of the VUE compared to both the Liberty and CR-V is the polymer side panels. I'd suspect that they won't dent as easily should debris encounter it on the road.That, plus there are some pretty good incentives on the VUE, as the '08 replacement is just around the corner.Do you require any special equipment, or will a base model work for you?(note that I'm biased toward the VUE as we have one in our family) "
"mark156","February 2007"," I most likely will never go off road.... I never planned to go off road with my Land Rover either! I want four-wheel drive for snow or icy situations. It makes an amazing difference vs. just FWD.Michaell, I'm considering a fully loaded unit with leather, heated seats and nav. We'll see what I end up with.The previous CR-V that I looked at listed for almost $30,000 with all of the dealer added on crap. I think the real MSRP was about $25,000 for a loaded CR-V.Do Saturn Vue's have AWD offered?Mark156 "
"kyfdx","February 2007"," I like the ability to disconnect the drivetrain from the wheels, when you are towing.. "
"michaellno","February 2007"," Yep, the VUE can be equipped with AWD with the V6. In fact, that's what my wife drives -- AWD, V6, leather, heated seats, sunroof, side airbags. About the only thing she wishes she had is the AUX input for her iPod.Her's is an '04 model year bought in November '04. 30K miles and the only major issue so far was a bum steering rack that needed to be replaced.Remember that the V6 in the VUE for '07 is the venerable 3.5L engine that is also found in the Honda Ridgeline, Pilot and Odyssey. Same 5-speed automatic as well.Very nice combination in a vehicle that weighs less than 3500 pounds.Good luck and let us know how the shopping goes! "
"boomchek","February 2007"," The CRV has a special sequence you do with the auto tranny shifter before towing it in order to set it up for towing.Don't know if that disconnects the drivetrian but it does something. :confuse: "
"growwise","February 2007"," I want four-wheel drive for snow or icy situations. It makes an amazing difference vs. just FWD.I know what you mean after experiencing it first time yesterday morning. It was a piece of cake even going uphill on backroads with thick layer of ice and snow on top of it. Many FWD cars were slipping and sliding while I was running circles around them in my new 07 mitsubishi outlander. It has a 4WD lock setting along with 2WD and 4WD. 4wd is more like CR-V except a little power always goes to rear regardless of slipping of front wheels. More power is allocated if pedal is mashed or going uphill or when slippage occurs. 4WD lock is more power to rear wheels in all situations. Best part is that once I was on highway, just turned the knob to 2WD and my gas consumption figures fell back in line. However, I need to be mindful that 4WD wont let me stop any better but thanks to ABS with EBD, traction & stability control I was fine. "
"akangl","February 2007"," My week has not gone as planned. As some of you remember I sold the Sebring back in October for $2500, well the deal ended up being (because the guy ran short of money) $1000 down and the rest in payments. Fast forward 4 months, haven't seen another dime past the $1000, he called me saying he was hoping his tax return would be enough to pay it off, it wasn't. So, we got the car back last night. On the bright side, I only had $1000 into the car so I basically own it for nothing now. Its clean, they put about 400 miles on it, so no harm done. Downside is, I have to sell the darn thing again!We are still most likely getting the 93 Explorer as well, so that will put us up to 5 vehicles........ugh. :sick: "

I test drove the Honda CR-V. I found the perfect vehicle... with the right equipment but it was FWD. I decided that FWD might be fine. When I called the dealer back about an hour later saying I would take the CR-V, it had been sold. They move mighty fast!!! Even at MSRP! ($28,000)My salesman thinks he can find one tomorrow from another dealer. We'll see.Looked at the Jeep Liberty. My local dealer didn't have any 4x4's... they thought they could locate one. After all was said and done, they wanted list price!!! ($30,000) minus rebate of $3,000. I said NO WAY. Rebates are factory money... the dealer wasn't coming off a dime. I walked.There is no way I'm paying MSRP for a Jeep.I think the Honda will come through one way or another (hopefully). It drove very nice and had a COLD strong blowing air conditioner which is very important to me. It was the color I wanted (Borrego Beige) had a sunroof, leather, heated seats and a nav with rear camera. Very peppy engine with only 4 cylinders and 166 HP.

Just looked, sat in a bunch of cars, no test drives as the salesmen were circling & I knew after a test drive they'd try to get me back in their cubicle & start working me over.....Acuras: MDX seemed smaller inside than I thought(?). Seemed a bit claustrophobic for the size even, but I think some of that was that it doesn't seem to have a lot of glass area. RDX seemed fine, smallish. I liked the interior of the TL the best, seemed the ""airiest"", & roomiest. One thing I noticed was that the doors on the MDX & the RDX seemed much less weighty or substantial than on my E39 5-series, which are like bank vault doors in comparison. And the interiors didn't seem ""nicer"", or roomier, than on my 6 y.o. bmw, except for the interior of the TL possibly. Hondas: Sat in an Si. For $22K, given the performance I've read about, I was getting very good ""Honda Vibes"". The super-low-profile tires wouldn't last long around here I think tho. Looked at an LX Pilot--I thought it looked kind of ""cheap"" inside. Plenty of room tho, but I didn't get much of an impression of a ""personality"". Ridgeline: That I was getting interested in. Seemed like a pretty cool vehicle with a definite personality, & for whatever reasons I was much more interested in it than the Pilot. I'm putting the Ridgeline on my ""list"". I didn't see the new CR-V as I wanted to get out of there before the salesman started getting weird on me.

My Honda experience has been overwhelmingly positive, they have been doing this for so long now they pretty much have the formula of weight/price/durability. That said, the Rabbit felt a lot sturdier than the Civic and the Contour felt sturdier than the Accord. While things aren't exactly equal, the Civic was around longer than the Rabbit and the Accord was around longer than the Contour (by years but not miles, I suppose).Another thing to keep in mind is you're comparing a 40k car to a 20k car in E39 dollars, or a 40k car to a 60k car in current dollars :P "

"tifighter","March 2007"," I bought a Forester X last year for a ski car. Does well in snow and have had nothing go wrong on it. When I bought it, I figured I would have 1 passenger, maybe 2 max, for a few ski trips of about 2-3 hours each way. What has happened instead this season are lots of trips with 2 or 3 passengers and a big load of gear. This has brought a few weaknesses up: 1) Power-when you load this car up with 4 adults, gear and 4 pair of skis and drive it up a pass, the world can move slowly. And I have the stick, not auto. 2)Maybe some more cargo room in the back for gear? I have a big box on the roof, but 4 pair of skis and poles fill that up pretty well. 3)Rear seats are really tight for adults.Other things I'd like-Ipod connectivitySide curtainsHeated anythingMaybe Nav and/or BluetoothLower the height, the better (when roof box meets underground parking...I live downtown in a large city)Some possible solutions-1. Forester Turbo-Does not solve the cargo problem but sure solves the power issue. Nicely equipped and should be a lot of fun. Old design and no side curtains. Should be able to work the price a bit. 2. RAV 4 V6-It's bigger, and has the power. Good mileage and makes full power on regular gas. Wonder if its any fun to drive at all. Automatic only. Harder to deal on. Toyota dealers are evil.3. Outback-Bigger cargo area. Same power unless you jump to the turbo which is a lot more money. I like the 4 cyl LL Bean spec, but comes in Automatic(4spd!)only so it will be slower than current car. Lowest roof and nice interior. 4. Mitsu Outlander-These seem pretty nice; good power and lots of gadgets. Can get Nav, HIDs...the works. Probably a depreciation nightmare (especially bad thing for CCBA-ers)and gets the worst gas mileage of the group.Any of you drive these things? Anything I missed?

"growwise","March 2007"," Any of you drive these things?Me :shades: ..I have had 07 mitsubishi outlander XLS for couple weeks now. I am not a mitsu type of guy but this vehicle is truly a good one. The only option that is not on mine is NAV with HDD along with rear dvd player.Here is what works for me1. Redesign is very easy on the eyes in and out. Looks good and IMHO, way better than most of its competitors. A very cohesive design of both the exterior and interior (atleast my top of the line XLS)2. For not much more money than FWD midsize cars, you get more versatility and features3. AWD came real handy with freak winter snow storms. I am a believer now in 4wd.4. ASC (active skid and traction control) which was invisible also came to the rescue when I got too cocky and tried to change lanes on slippery roads (cutting power and balancing it out)5. ABS with EBD has come to aid several times already but what made it more effective where those 18 inch wheels with low profile tires.6. Leather seats are very useful with dog hair (my Labrador retriever sheds a lot) and look good IMO (black interior through out). Front Heated seatbacks are a bonus over the usual bunwarmers. My wife really appreciates this.7. Rear seats are highly adjustable (fore and aft) and make the entry/exit to third row quite a snap (lighting is a nice touch)8. Third row makes sure that this vehicle will meet all my potential future needs. I have inlaws/parents visiting and with one kid on the way in couple months and hopefully second one not too far in the future, its nice to know that you wont run out of seats.9. Rear cargo area is good for all situations (luggage, doggie, heavy duty walmart shopping, stroller in near future etc). Third row is stowed for now.10. 650 watt stereo is good and steering wheel mounted controls along with 6 cd changer/mp3 are a bonus.11.

I am not into skiing or biking. So no point in calling Thule guys.Nit picks include1. Sound insulation not on par with Toyotas. Lets more noise in (relatively speaking)2. Suspension is a bit tight for my taste but I can see the safety point of view.3. No heated steering wheel. It gets really cold up here.4. Interest rate a bit rich for my blood but that is to be expected when a new model enters the market. But Mitsu dealer was very lenient with my trade-in. Gave me lot more money than what Honda dealer was willing to give. Resale value should be decent for this new model iteration. If not, then the high trade-in value will compensate for some of that.5. No Xenon lights for canadian XLS.personally, I would have taken a Rav4 Limited V6 over Outlander XLS but since I already stretched my budget, I couldnt digest the 6k price difference which will be more once the Toyota dealer's trade-in appraisal is included. Besides, I am in it for the long haul unlike most CCBAers here  "
"nippononly","March 2007"," ""Probably a depreciation nightmare (especially bad thing for CCBA-ers)and gets the worst gas mileage of the group""This kills all potential Mitsubishis for me. I have liked one or two enough to consider them, but being a seriously die-hard CCBAer, I have steered away from brands with really steep depreciation, like Mitsu. The new Outlander looks like one really sweeeet ride apart from that, though.I have ridden in the RAV4 V-6 Limited a few times now (have a friend with one), have driven it once. IMO it has an excess of power, yet fuel economy still seems OK for a V-6. You could get the Sport instead of the Limited, which has the 18"" rims and is supposed to be a pretty sporty ride. But the inside of the RAV leaves a lot to be desired in its price range, I think. I am sure the Outlander has it beaten hands down in that category. "
"mark156","March 2007"," tifighter, another suggestion would be the new Honda CR-V. I have a deposit on one now that should arrive to the dealership in about a week.My choices were more limited as I bought this vehicle to pull behind my new motorhome. My towing guide does not list any Mitsubishi as towable. Also, there are no Toyota SUV's listed that can be towed.I was really shocked at the power of the 4 cylinder 166 hp engine of the CR-V. Mine will be AWD, have nav w/rear backup camera, sunroof and leather w/heated seats.The only limitations in towing is that I'm not allowed to go over 65 mph and I have to recirculate the transmission fluid every 8 hours of towing.Probably one of the easiest tow vehicles would be a Jeep product with the lever to disengage the drivetrain. I was considering the Liberty but there were so many things I liked about the Honda. Both the Honda CR-V and Jeep Liberty both list for about $30K.Good points about the CR-V compared to the Liberty...1) Spare tire inside vehicle2) Rear center arm rest with cup holder3) Lift gate vs. swing-out tailgate4) Better gas mileage, Honda AWD 22/28, Jeep 4wd 20/245) Honda weighs 3,500 lbs, Jeep weighs 4,044 lbs.6) Honda offers rear camera with nav.Advantage of Liberty over CR-V1) Better off-road c abilities2) Can tow 4 wheels down with no limitations Mark156  "

If you are trying to improve resale, that would be a factor.Resale is a big deal for a CCBA-er; a big reason I can entertain making a move is because the Subaru holds its value well and that gives me options.

It's nice to the stand under the swing open gate on the Subie and put the ski boots on, protected from the rain (hey, I'm in Seattle; we ski in rain). Other issue: I was skiing last week and saw a guy in a new RAV V6 Sport trying to drive up an pretty gentle snow-covered (maybe 4 inches)slope. He stopped for some reason, and when he tried to get going again, and the front tires AND rear tires just spun. Now, I know the RAV has a button that locks power to the front and rear at 55/45 and I don't think this guy switched it on.

"nvbanker","March 2007"," Ok, Friday I bought an 03 Escalade EXT (that's the Avalanche truck version Cadillac makes). 44,000 miles, after the weekend, has 45,000 miles. Paid $30,000 for it. It had 22"" wheels on it - so before I even got it home, I went to a wheel shop and bought a set of Original Cadillac 17"" chrome wheels with OE Goodyear tires on them for it. I know, I know, everyone puts 22"" wheels on their Cadillacs, but they just don't convey my image at all, and the truck handles much better with the factory engineered wheels on it. I'm taking a lot of grief for doing that, but I can sell the 22""s easily I think. This is a nice truck, and a departure from my usual anti-GM buying habits. It's low tech like most GM cars are, but they do make their Low Tech cars run pretty well, I'll admit. It has a great HVAC system in it, probably one of the best I've experienced at keeping me just right automatically. Really like the truck - however, it's too expensive to keep around just as an occasional driver. I'll have to get rid of it pretty soon. So, why did I buy it in the first place? Got it at the Auction for a trip to my mountain cabin over the weekend. It was quite useful for the trip and did extremely well in the mud and snow. "

"akangl","March 2007"," I went this little BHPH lot yesterday to look at a 98 4Runner that appeared to be a pretty good deal. While I was looking at it, a guy who worked there was trying to turn his Suburban around (tight quarters) and backed into my truck. I was less than thrilled to say the least. My truck now needs a new bumper which just makes me really happy. He said he didn't see my truck, I'm thinking ""how can you miss a 1-ton black Dodge Ram??"" :sick: Anyway, the 4Runner turned out to be a reconstruct, not something that bothers me a whole lot. It drove nice, had a lot of miles on it, but seemed to run well. They offered me $1500 for my Sebring and they would pay the shipping from Fairbanks. I think I'm going to pass on it and keep looking. I can do better I think. They had a 2000 4Runner with 135k on it that I also drove, really nice truck, but something gave me the creeps about it, couldn't put my finger on it.I'm pretty much limiting my search to 4Runners, Pathfinders, and possibly Explorers depending on how they are mechanically. Trying not to spend over $5k for this beater. Yesterday confirmed to me that I do need a beater, these Anchorage trips stress me out about having my black truck down here.Would be nice to have an SUV that the dog can go with us in, we can take fishing, down the back trails, just in general use it for everything.

I bought it at the auction for the trip, because I need something of that size. (An Avalanche would do, but I couldn't find one with 4WD available at the time.) Trips over, I'd love to keep it, but can't justify a $30,000 investment for an occasional driver to be kept in the driveway and used on an off Saturday. But remember, oh my friend, I bought it at AUCTION, meaning, it shouldn't be too hard to make a grand on it and still give somebody a great deal. A dealer would expect to make twice that much on it, or more. Yes, I'll sell it, and make a dime.

Its not like me to step down to an older cheaper vehicle at all, I usually go the other way. I hate to say it, but Terry was right, I didn't *need* the Ram.I ran across a super nice 2001 Dodge Durango SLT Plus the other day for $12,500 at a dealership where a friend of mine is a sales manager. He appraised my truck and put as much as he could in it, diesels seem to be all over the place, he had 6 sitting on his lot with far less miles than mine. I wasn't too bad off in it and put down enough to cover all the negative equity. When it was all said and done my truck payment has dropped by more than 1/2, along with less insurance costs. Not to mention I have a far more practical vehicle with my daughter's ever increasing medical equipment, she has at least 4 bags when we travel. We still have 2 diesel trucks, plus the Durango, AND the Sebring, lol. I plan to pay the Durango off in 18 months, shouldn't be a problem with as little as I owe on it. "

"kyfdx","March 2007"," Okay.. the clock is ticking..My target date is Independence Day.. Anyone else?  "
"akangl","March 2007"," Had the Ram for almost 9 months and just shy of 21k miles. I liked it, but did NOT like the payment and insurance on it, holy cow that was hard. NEVER again will I pay that much in payment, that's just stupid. Not to mention it was silly paying that much for a truck that we truely did not need.The new *used* truck is a 2001 Dodge Durango SLT Plus, black with tan leather, non smoker's car (thankfully), its from NY orignally, one owner truck. Has about 70k on it, but we bought a Chrysler backed ESC to cover it another 50k or 5 years. It has a 4.7L V8, automatic, 4wd, heated seats, 3 row seat, infinity audio system, all the goodies. Clean carfax, no accident history at all, and I couldn't find any signs of paint damage or anything. Interior is very clean, rear seats don't look like they were ever used. It has a rear ent system, its aftermarket and I'm not sure it works, will probably replace it with a different one. Driving it you would never know it has 70k on it, I had a hard time believing that, it drives as well as a 20k car would.Old body style Durangos are HARD to find up here, they usually don't hang on a car lot for very long. Only other one I found was a 2000 SLT with 63k on it for the same price as this one. The dealer we bought this one from only had it a few days.Our payment went down a LOT, interest rate went down, term went down, and insurance went down. Can't ask for better than that! I feel pretty good about the Durango, I love the fact that we don't owe much on it and I can pay it off quickly. I want to own it free and clear. Maybe the junkyard gems are getting to me, I like having the title to my car and not owing the bank.My son already has his eye on it for his own, lol.

Second off, if I want to tow anything, we have 2 diesel trucks to do that job. I HATE towing anything, usually if something needs to be towed hubby is with me and doing the driving.As for the Sebring, nah, I think I'll probably keep it, have had it for sale for nearly a month and no takers.

That's very similar to my Ram only the gas for this thing is 32 cents/gal less than the fuel for the Ram.The Durango is having a major issue with the brakes, had it checked yesterday and it needs new brakes BAD. Not just brake pads either, but everything. I took it back to the dealer and they tried to say it was fine. The sales manager (not my friend who works there, but another manager) said that I was having buyer's remorse and offered to let me out of the deal. I laughed and said I didn't want my Ram back, I just want them to fix what they should have fixed before selling the car. He finally grabbed the keys from me and said he has owned 5 Durangos and knows what's normal. He said he was sure it was just fine. He drove it, came back and his whole attitude changed, he agreed it was dangerous and they needed to fix it. So we'll see, I'm supposed to take it over there this morning so they can look at it. I complained about the brakes before I bought it and they adjusted them, that worked for a couple days, just long enough for them to sell it. :sick: My fault I guess for not getting it checked out prior to buying it. I almost ran it out to my friend's house to have her hubby check it out, but didn't.If they don't fix it, not sure what I'll do, I don't want my Ram back and I really don't want anything else. I've come to really like the Durango in the past couple days. Parts are about $600 to fix it, I can fix it this weekend with my little brother's help, so its not the end of the world I guess. "
"qbrozen","March 2007"," everything?how do you know at this point it needs calipers? do you mean just rotors and pads? $600 is ALOT of money for just rotors and pads, though, so I assume you are talking calipers, too. But, again, I'm not sure how that was determined. You should be able to get rear rotors and pads for under $300, I would think, and you'd be good to go. (or does that have rear drums?) "

"nippononly","March 2007"," For the '07 Tacoma, the 4-cyl stick is rated at 23/28 mpg. Judging by past experience, I should be able to pull 26, 27 mpg routinely. That is my threshold of minimum acceptable gas mileage. While I like a lot about the Ridgeline, both the price and the gas consumption are too high. For one thing, I am thinking of a 2WD rather than a 4WD Tacoma. And I don't really need a double cab - I would go extended cab if I went ahead. And I agree, used Tacomas command outrageous prices. It would definitely be new or nothing for me. "

"woodyww","March 2007"," I went thru this exercise a few weeks ago. You get so much for your $$ with the Ridgeline--in size & features it's a lot more vehicle than the Taco, maybe more comparable to the Tundra (?).Ridgelines are heavily discounted, I think. They also depreciate, a lot. Then I read the edmunds L-T test on the Ridgeline--all the struts failed after they drove it 10 miles at moderate speeds on a country road (??!!).OTOH, you can drive a Toyota truck or SUV across Africa, or Australia, & probably not worry that much. (Just in case that situation ever comes up).....altho the Toyota stingy-ness with side & head airbags is a drag.As a former 1986 Toyota p/u (bought used) owner, who flogged it mercilessly for 3 years, did 1 oil change, & it cost me $75 in repairs & maintenence, I know what I'd do.....

They put it up on the rack and looked it over, they agreed with the brake shop I took it to, said it needed rotors, pads, calipers, rear drums, and shoes. They replaced all of it and did a brake fluid flush today. They ate the entire cost of the brake repair. The difference in the truck is night and day. My sales manager friend who was off when all this happened yesterday took it out and drove it after the repair to make sure it was safe, he said it was great. The GSM apologized to me today for how he treated me yesterday. He said he really thought it was buyer's remorse since I traded in such a nice newer truck. I told him I wasn't interested in having that truck back, I was happy with the Durango except for the brakes. He gave me a hug and said he was truely sorry for the way he acted.I drove it home this afternoon, its AWESOME!!! Averaged an easy 18 mpg which included going through the mountains.

That's why we bought the damn thing in the first place, it seemed like we got a lot of services for $407 before tax.The service manager contradicted himself a few times today and he did go speak with a higher up lady. I really think they knew they were wrong and finally did the right thing...for now. Hopefully the general manager will also do the right thing and fulfill the contract. No more of these plans in the future for us. Or more documentation will be gotten up front. Why do so many dealers pull this sh_t in the first place? And then they wonder why people do not trust them. The Sandman :mad: "
"corvette","March 2007"," I bet Mazda requires only a drain and fill for the radiator service. A lot of dealers buy radiator and tranny flush machines from third-party suppliers and then charge higher rates for these ""enhanced"" services. Honda specifically issued a service bulletin warning that they didn't approve of the transmission flush machines. With the cooling system, there's probably less to damage with the machine. My Nissan called for the first drain and fill at 60k and then every 30k thereafter. If I had the coolant flushed, I'd probably only do it every 60k, since probably 95+% of the fluid is exchanged with a flush, as opposed to probably 50% with a drain and fill. "

"sandman46","March 2007"," It's a 2005 mazda3s and the policy was to good to pass up. And I also knew that if we had it, my wife would finally take care of her car. We got 15 oil changes, 7 tire rotations, a tranny service at 30k miles & 2 coolant system flushes all before 45k miles or 36 months. We paid $407.00 plus tax. My figuring was based on each oil change being $20.00 which comes out to $300.00 right there. I felt the extra $107.00 was well worth the other services. And I knew if we bought it, the wife would buckle down and use it, as she hates to waste $!Good news is the general manager spoke with the wife this morning and will fulfill the rest of the contract. He just wants her to bring in our documentation tomorrow morning so he can sign off on it. I'm glad for that but have learned a lesson here...NO MORE MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS. 3k oil changes are really ludicris in this day and age and the other services can definitely be done at later mileage intervals.The Sandman  "

When my ex & I owned Toyotas & Hondas, we'd run them up to at least 50 or 60K miles, & barely do any maintenance except for a few oil changes, & sometimes 8K between those I think.

With a heavy load (3 people + trailer) it falls quickly to barely adequate, but that is having the vehicle and the trailer at roughly the GCVWR payload limits. "

Hee Hee!! :P Funny thing about the Rolls... it's doesn't have 'Park' on the automatic transmission selector. On the column it reads..""N D 3 2 R"". If you put the selector in Reverse (with the engine off), it will act as Park and the car will not move. But, when starting the car, you have to put it back in Neutral. And, ALWAYS set the parking brake! There is a big yellow light on the dash to let you know if the parking brake is set.When I take it to restaurants, I never allow the valet to park it. I will ask them if I can utilize the valet service (usually parking in front) but park it myself. Any restaurant that I've done that, they have never said no. Sometimes, they will move another car out of a line so that I can park the Rolls in front.... I guess, it looks good to have a classy antique showing in front. I call my Cloud a ""20 footer"" as it looks good 20 feet away. As you get closer, you can tell it has a little age on it. I think the repaint was done maybe 15 yrs ago (I've owned it almost 9 years).Whenever I think of getting rid of it...

For me, a better option would be to cosign the loan and require payments to be made to me which I would personally transfer to the BHPH (or whoever) and be listed as a second leinholder (if that is possible) or...even better, pay for the car in full with my own funds, list myself as the leinholder, and collect monthly payments from the relatives to pay me back.

"mark156","April 2007"," I just put 1,500 miles on my new CR-V in the last three days. WOW, this CR-V is one nice little car. It is amazing how they can get so much power out of 168 hp. I had no problem driving the 75 mph speed limit and had enough power to pass if needed.And, it came with three months of XM radio! I have never used XM or Sirius radio. It sure is nice when driving across the country when the regular radio has no reception.Isell...

"akangl","April 2007"," Yes, I know I am taking some chances here, but it was either this or one of them would have to leave their job, which would result in some big problems really fast. I hope it works out. He has assured me he will keep full insurance in force and I will come get the car if he says he can no longer do that. One way to limit your risk in the event of an accident is to put the car in their name and you on as lienholder. That way they ""own"" the car, but you still keep you interest in it in the event they ""forget"" to pay. That's the best way to do it I think, course I've been down this road a couple times. :sick: When I advertised the Sebring for sale last month it was super popular with the ""can I make payments?"" crowd. Just had someone call me the other day about it (from the old ad) asking if I would discount the price to account for the repairs (thought I had already done that??) and would I take payments on it. Um, no and NO. "

"woodyww","April 2007"," I didn't see if you hold the title in your name--I think it sounds like your name is on the title, or the loan? If so I agree with all the cautionary feed-back you've gotten from others about having legal responsibility on a vehicle being driven by others. My amateur 2-cents: If you had only co-signed on the loan, & the car & ins. was in their name, at least your responsibility would be limited to paying the loan off if they didn't. But I don't know who's name the ins. is in, yours, or theirs??FWIW, I've had experience with acquaintences or relatives who are always behind the financial 8-ball, & generally it sort of never seems to end. I'd be way more worried about what could happen if they were in an accident with the car, & maybe(?) the ins. had lapsed, or they didn't have enough liability, & it came back to haunt you somehow.....than I'd be about their blowing the engine on a 150K mile camry.....(Hope I understood your post correctly!)

It's like going into the dealership and expecting to get your brand spanking new Ford Crown Victoria in Powder Blue but getting it in Butternut Creme! There were several updates on the 2008 from 2007 which were nice..... like the new 70 gallon grey water tank (was 56 gal. on the 2007).The original color was burgundy w/beige and gold swirls. The new one is dark brown with an ecru base with swirling graphics that fade from brown to rust to gold.... very nice looking with a crisp contemporary look. I can't believe my salesman didn't realize the color change for the new model.

"mark156","April 2007"," Once you get the motor home make sure they give you the full rundown on how to operate everythingYes, I agree! The factory has set aside two days for me to have access to 2 tech guys if I have any questions or if something is not just right. My salesman will meet me at the factory for delivery. Monaco has the 'white glove' PDI that is supposed to catch anything that is not perfect.Also, I have heat pumps for heat so I'm not lighting anything! I even had the propane tank removed as it only worked the counter top stove... I had an electric cook-top put in. The hot water is called ""Aqua Hot"" and runs off diesel fuel or electric. If using diesel, it uses a half a gallon per hour. They say that you have endless hot water if you want it. The Aqua hot system also heats the tile floor to keep the coach's temp more even in cold weather camping.I have two heat systems and three roof air systems, so, keeping it ""just like home"" shouldn't be a problem.People are also telling me to get a front cover for the Honda while towing. I certainly have thought about it as I don't want any rock chips, broken headlights or a broken windshield. So, I made a point to start noticing all of the campers towing vehicles and I found that maybe one out of ten might have a shield to protect the front of the toad (dingy). I will certainly check into getting something.Mark156 "

If I put lots of miles on the CR-V, I'll still be able to bring decent money in five years.

Tonight, I connected to the water and electricity, filled the water tank and turned to walk back to the Honda to turn off the engine (warming it up to run through the gears per Honda rules)... and banged my head on the corner of the slide-out.

"mjfloyd1","April 2007"," the bmw warranty would then be a 2 year extension since i have such low miles. it is $3800. Pretty expensive 2 year warranty. thats the rub with the factory warranty. "
"nyccarguy","April 2007"," My Dad has an '04 X5 3.0iA SP with over 66,000 miles on the odometer. The only problems he's had with it are the rear hatch unlocked by itself while he was driving (never fully popped open) & relay that got some moisture in it that has caused the Angel Eyes on the left side to go out. It has NEVER once been in the shop outside the scheduled maintenance. He had the front pads & rotors replaced during Inpection I and just recently the rear brake pads at just over 60K miles. If you're worried about future repair & maintenance costs, check out some of the independent BMW mechanics in your area. Your dealer isn't the only game in town. "

"woodyww","April 2007"," It's got such low miles, it seems a shame to sell it just because the warranty is running out. If it were a trouble-prone make or model, I'd understand. I dumped my Range Rover 6 mo. before the warranty ran out, but I'd had tons of trouble with it in the year I'd owned it. How I came to own my current bmw, which has given me way less trouble in 4.5 years than the RR did in one.There's a really good X5 board ""on another website""--it'd be worth it to post your questions there. There are guys there with even early X5's ('00's, '01's) with 100K miles who don't seem to have had a lot of trouble.Is it fear of owning any vehicle that's out of warranty, or just a bmw? There are people here & elsewhere who've had newer vehicles WITH warrantys that drove them nuts because of constant problems (inc. me, with my RR, & my VW).But if buying an ext. warranty will placate the wife, I'd say, best commence to warranty shopping! "
"kyfdx","April 2007"," I wouldn't buy an extended warranty.. As you note, with such low miles, you probably won't get your money's worth out of a warranty or an extended maintenance plan..Since the vehicle is paid off, why not put the $4000 that it would cost for an extended warranty/maintenance plan in the bank? Use it to fund any repairs or maintenance required until the car is six years old.. At the rate you are going, the car will only have 50K miles or less, by then... and, you will probably have money left over, and the car should bring a good price with the low miles.Seems like a cheap way to keep driving a really nice vehicle for the next 2 yrs and 7 months... regards,kyfdx(except for the wife thing.. maybe you should trade..  ) "
"akangl","April 2007"," I committed the number one cardinal motorhome sin today. I hit my head on the bedroom slide-out. It is known that you always wear a baseball cap when working around the motorhome. Tonight, I connected to the water and electricity, filled the water tank and turned to walk back to the Honda to turn off the engine (warming it up to run through the gears per Honda rules)... and banged my head on the corner of the slide-out. It just about knocked me out and I fell to the ground skinning my knees... so, here I sit with a bandage on my head and band-aid patches on my knees... a real good look as I have a black-tie event in 17 days.. I hope that I heal enough to look presentable! Sorry Mark, had to laugh. Last summer we had the TT at a campground and hubby was busy doing something around the other side of it when I heard a THUD and him yell. I had left the bedroom window open, it swings out due to being an emergency exit window. He just about scalped himself on it. Needless to say he makes a WIDE circle around the TT now.Dealership says we have to pick it up May 1st, lol, so we are on the hunt for a new storage location for it.

"mjfloyd1","April 2007"," Thanks for the reality check. I am afraid of a large repair bill on an out of warranty vehicle. It's not a bmw thing for me - I have a 95 325icA with less than 25k miles as well and it's completely reliable as long as I keep the battery tender on. (The X5 has only had routine maintainance and a rare minor problem - a door lock actuator occaisionally wouldn't work and it was replaced and works fine.)The bmw warranty makes absolutely no sense for me with the low miles, and a bmw finance person suggested the zurich plan. I was offered a zero deductible 48 month/ 60k mile plan and a 2 year bmw factory maintainance plan for a little over 3000 dollars. I don't know anything about zurich, but an associate has a Lamborghini which he bought as a factory demo with 5k miles and he got a zurich extended warr with it - but surprisingly to me, he never had to use it. He did say that he knew others that had used theirs with no problems. I did also call the local independent mechanic who said that the zurich plan was one of the better ones that they had dealt with. I do wonder if the zurich plan would pay for diagnosis of a problem and if it requires non factory parts or refurbished parts.I generally don't keep a vehicle for more than 3 or 4 years and very rarely put more than 50K miles on a car before I get upgraditis. My problem right now is that nothing really floats my boat. The 530ix is OK but gets very pricey when loaded up. The infiniti m35x seems nice but I haven't driven one. I drove a v6 audi Q7 and it was just a very heavy vehicle - it seemed slower than my X5 and didn't handle anywhere near as well. I've had a suv (or is it sav) since 2000 (toyotal landcruiser and then X5), and don't know if I'd adjust to sitting down low again, but then again with gas at 2.89 a gallon for regular perhaps I should learn to adjust. I don't know how well a car would work as I need to be able to get to the hospital in all sorts of Indiana weather in quite a hurry sometimes - it snowed 18 inches just one week after I got rid of my landcruiser.My wife isn't concerned about repair bills or maintainance, she is concerned that we will both want new cars during the same year. It's more of a timing issue for her.Mark "
"kyfdx","April 2007"," Just keep it until you find something else you want.. and keep the money in your wallet.. What if you buy the warranty, then find something you really want the next month?Trading in the wife? Hadn't thought of that.. I think I'd lease the next time, though.. "

"railroadjames","April 2007"," I own a 3 1/2 yr old Toyota Prius ('04) with a 2 part warrantee (3 yr 36K on regular components & 8 yr 100K on the Hybrid sys.)

One in particular demanded I put a special bottle in the radiater and all maintanence be done by dealer and keep extensive records. I decided not to go that route. Now I'm of a mind to just wing it till I purchase a new car next yr. By the way, the Prius has been outstanding. A hatchback with more room than most full size cars...Room for 5...45-50 mpg's ...dependability and very ""GREEN."" Tax breaks and no EPA tests. Time spent in gas stations less than 1 min. compared to SUV's & Hummers 6-7 min. Gas savings adding up to approx. 3 grand per yr (17K-18K miles per yr). Just love the smartness of the car.

"bumpy","April 2007"," He didn't pay for much, deciding to get out while the getting was good. He bought it in 2003 and had all kinds of things go wrong the first year he had it: harmonic balancer broke apart, catalytic converter failed, driver's side mirror cracked, window motor failed, it ate headlight bulbs, etc. All of that was under warranty. It behaved itself for a while after that, then he had a brake job done on it at the beginning of the year. Somehow one of the front wheel bearings was munged up in the process; the bearing failed and destroyed the spindle soon afterwards. The new spindle had to come across the Atlantic, which took a while. I think that, along with the constant stream of horror stories he heard chatting with other forlorn MB owners in the service lounge, finally did the trick and sent him back to the Yote. He had a '99 Camry before the Benz and his wife got a Rav4 last fall. "

I was highly unimpressed: it seemed ""dinky"", at least inside, with a very tiny cargo area. Made the cargo area in my 5-series wagon seem huge in comparison, altho I'm not sure the measurements are all that different. Cheap interior materials. Mediocre audio quality. I thought it drove well however, at least on the 5 minute city test-drive.

"fezo","April 2007"," I'm one of those folks that think for the most part the last generation CR-V was a nicer looking vehicle than the new one. Enough so that were I in the market I might go over to Toyota. "
"stickguy","April 2007"," Is nice enough, but does have one key flaw (IMO), that other Honda's share. I find it impossible to get a comfortable seat angle in a car with non-power seats. That's a big reason I passed on the Civic and ended up with an Accord.Mazda did the same thing with the 3. Instead of front/rear height adjustments (allowing for some adjustment of the seat cushion angle), you get a ratchet lever that pitches you forward as it raises up. Even fully down (where I don't always want to be), I still want the front to tilt up a tad more.If I was getting a small ute thingee like this, I actually prefer the Rav4. Power seat, and the V6 was sweet! "
"woodyww","April 2007"," I was a little surprised I didn't like the CR-V a bit more, after all the hype about it.Yesterday I drove: 2 '07 Tacoma double-cabs, 4wd, 6 cyl, auto. One with TRD OR, one w/o. Somewhat trucky-driving of course, altho pretty darn smooth overall, for a truck. Lots of agricultural-sounding engine noise on hard acceleration. Real nice interior I thought; too bad no S/R. Dealer said invoice minus the $500 rebate. Wanted to drive a stick but had none.Also an '04 4runner LTD 6cyl. 4wd with animal bites in the interior(?), asking $28K-ish. I thought it drove well; nothing remarkable one way or another. I didn't like the dash area--it looked cheap & plasticky & cluttered--not 1/2 as nice as the Taco. Dealer said invoice minus the $1500 rebate on new ones. I also don't think I need a LTD--I saw a new SR5 & I thought the fabric seats looked really nice. With S/R, side bags, & something else, sticker on it was $33.5K-ish.Of course I'd probably have given huge bonus points for both if I'd have driven them in snow, & thought more about getting out of my driveway in Winter.I have no clue--the value of my nice running, low mileage 5 series keeps plumeting according to edmunds. And the interior is like out of a Rolls compared to hondas or toyotas. But I sure do have the itch. A new Taco--not the most practical for me, but ""I could live with it"", & the great resale has huge appeal. Sometimes--I see super-low miles '05 SR5 or Sport 4runners in the low $20's.....I think most of the depreciation would be wrung out at that point. Might as well try to test drive a Pilot, RDX, & V-6 RAV also. Have looked online at used X-5's, but they're real expensive; might as well buy a new RDX..... :confuse: "

I agree that my Escape is also very utilitarian, but she is not going to win any beauty contests either.But what do I know, I liked the first generation Rav-4. "
"smittynyc","May 2007"," Yeah, I am hardly a stickler when it comes to how a car looks -- I'm a former Forester and current Legacy owner, after all -- but the steelies on the base CRV just ruin an otherwise fine-looking car.I've liked every restyle of the CRV less than the previous. My favorite is the original. There are a couple of flawlessly maintained ones in my neighborhood, and they look fantastic imo. "
"guss","May 2007"," I messed up on Sunday and stopped by local Honda dealer to walk the lot. Dealer are closed here on Sunday's so you can browse without getting hassled.I went to check out the new Civics because my company may institute a new bonus program if you get a more fuel efficient car . I get my gas paid for so fuel mileage has not been my biggest concern when buying a car , but with the new program it gives me at least a reason to shop (like we all need one).I did not realize the mileage numbers were so good on the Civic,30/40 is excellent . I just wonder if I could actually get 35mpg. The sedans looks to me at first were kind of odd, but I think odd is growing on me now.Funny thing was that even though the dealer was closed they had an EX model with the key sticking out of the drivers side door. After sitting in it and checking out the headroom (which was excellent) and the seats I dropped the key in the showroom mail slot. Hopefully the lot boy does not get in trouble. I'll have to get over there and try the backseat to see if the three kids fit back there. "
"nippononly","May 2007"," I could be wrong, but I do believe the steel rims on the new CRV LX are the same size as the alloys: 17"". Which IMO is why they look a little odd - steel rims that large would look weird to me on any vehicle short of a pick-up truck. And geez, for what little cost it must be to the manufacturer, I don't know why they don't just put privacy glass in ALL the SUV/crossover/minivans these days, regardless of trim. "
"boomchek","May 2007"," I agree with you guys on the base CRV. The steelies are 17 inch, and look horrible.As for the tint, believe it or not some people don't want it.The thing that makes the Esx and up CRVs look better is not only the tint, or the wheels, but thge chrome grille, and tailgate garnish. "
"woodyww","May 2007"," I love the tint/privacy glass on a lot of current SUV's. One of the things I don't like on my current car are: no tint/privacy glass, & it has chrome trim, which looks dated. And people can look in on all your luggage/stuff/whatever-you've-got in the vehicle.I actually like the ext. looks of the new CRV; at least the EX-L; haven't seen a base model with the steel wheels.I might have liked the CRV I drove a little more if the salesman & dealership hadn't been so crazy & overbearing--I couldn't think for 2 seconds about the car w/o the salesman controlling & talking. The Toyota store I went to out in the burbs--they just threw me the keys on whatever I wanted to drive, & quoted me invoice minus whatever rebates. "
"perna","May 2007"," I messed up on Sunday and stopped by local Honda dealer to walk the lot. Dealer are closed here on Sunday's so you can browse without getting hassled. I did the exact same thing a couple weeks ago. They left out a silver 5 spd Fit, unlocked. Now, I don't know what the salespeople in this forum think of this, but when I go to a closed car lot and there is an open car, I throw caution to the wind and plop down inside. Now, traditionally I've not liked Hondas for two reasons: 1. park bench hard seats, and 2. crummy cheap LCD dash, and loads of small and weirdly shaped buttons. Not only did the Fit not have these issues, but it actually, ah, ""fit"" me like a glove. The shifter felt right at home in my hand as well. Still, I can't see myself trading in the Maxima for one. Small and zippy is fun, but not overwhelmingly practical or safe. "

The Receptionist pointed me to the rack of literature and not one salesman asked if they could help me. So I walked the lot for about 10 minutes and again, not one salesman in sight.Things must be really good at the Honda stores. "

Now if I could just fast forward the 18 months its going to take to pay off the Durango!The Durango isn't a bad little SUV, it does what its told, it rarely grumbles, gets decent gas mileage, its ok for now. I'm going to get shocks replaced on it this week, then its got an appt at the dealer for some other stuff in June. Not much wrong with it really.......but, I still want a Pilot! "

Haven't really priced them, but the Honda dealer where I drove a CRV was ranting about what a great deal I could get on a Pilot.The first year depreciation hit on a new Pilot, 4runner, or even a RAV4 would not be inconsequential, I think. Also I read thru some of the Pilot owner's reviews on edmunds--there were a few fairly disgruntled owners, but who knows?For me, I've seen a couple of super low mileage '05 or '06 4runners on craigs list recently, between $23 & $25K I think. They both went fast--everyone says how many used 4runners there are 4sale, but super-nice ones priced well seem to sell.But I'm just kind of into the Toyota-truck-reputation thing--not saying you shouldn't get a Pilot!

The 250 mile drive turned into a weekend adventure but we eh, met some nice people in some really small towns (quietly hums theme from Deliverance). Actually, the project vehicle was small enough that the support vehicle could drag it for short distances at a time (and over Cuesta Grade), and its amazing the stuff that you can find in a NAPA auto parts in a small town.Its important to check major stuff before heading on the highway on a previously dead car. Tires, brakes, and major suspension components (idler arms, tie rods, etc) and anything blatantly wrong with the motor (missing pieces, fire hazards, bad hoses/belts, leaking like a sieve, etc).If you really have nothing going on, and a vehicle that can keep you from dehydrating and dying on the side of the road, you can do alright.

Can you feel the CR-V back there?Keep in mind, these things are made for the 70+ crowd to drive.. so, it drives like a big Cadillac Fleetwood! LOL! It has ten airbags that are constantly monitored by the computer to keep the coach even with no swaying. It is amazing how easy it is to drive. As long as you are aware of the height and width, it's a piece of cake to maneuver through traffic and smaller streets. The major concern are low tree branches. I think the height is 12'4"". I have a button on the leveling system pad that will raise the tag axle for tighter turns. If it's not raised, the tires will be dragged on the pavement (faster wear).The CR-V is like pulling a feather... 44,000 lbs. vs 3,400 lbs. I had the air brakes from the coach attached to the CR-V... so, every time I apply the brakes on the coach, the Honda's brakes are applied at the same exact pressure. If I were in an accident (rear-ending someone), the police would be all over me like a spider monkey on Mountain Dew (taken from Talladega Nights movie)  . Most states require that the towed vehicle have it's own braking system. I knew that if I needed to stop in an emergency situation, I didn't want 3,400 lb.s of Honda to push me an extra two feet. Every inch counts in an emergency!For 2008, the stripes on the side are ""fading stripes"".. that was a rather expensive option before that is now standard. Kinda looks like flames!Mark156  "

I think that's still true in some cases: Accords, Civics, Tacos & maybe CRV's have great resale. And of course you have to Pay thru the Nose for used Land Cruisers; that seems to be some sort of law or something.Pilots, 4runners, Ridgelines, possibly (?) RAV4's you'll take a big hit in the first year.

Also, I don't find it a hassle to drive.I wanted to travel the country and I like the fact that I don't have to live out of a suitcase. I was just in Las Vegas for 5 nights at the Outdoor Resorts. Beautiful RV park with million plus units parked side by side. I think one of the things that I like most is that almost (really most) all the people in RV parks/resorts are very friendly. You don't really get that in hotels.Apparently, in the Outdoor Resorts, it's the 'thing' to have a matching-color golf cart to go with your coach. Since most people buy the lots in Outdoor Resorts, they put in fountains, special landscaping, outdoor kitchens, bars, etc. We were in the 'daily rental' section. Owners of the lots can also rent theirs out if they want. Mark156 "

"akangl","May 2007"," You guys crack me up! Yes its a 2006 Ford Focus wagon, nicely loaded, cute car. I'm not thrilled about the color, but they sure have it discounted big time! I really did love my Zippy........miss her all the time!However, I highly doubt I'll do it, I don't really care for the Durango, but its liveable I guess. Thankfully its nearly horse show season so I'll have the dually most of the time and won't have to drive the Durango except for a couple times a month. If things go right this summer I can have it paid off by December.......THEN can I get a new car??? "
"guss","May 2007"," I happened to stop by my Ford dealer about 2 weeks ago to check out 2007 Focus wagons. He said they don't even order them any more because they don't sell very well.I think you can bargain pretty hard on a used one because the new one have a $3k rebate even though I think they are selling pretty well. I guess everyone is waiting for the 2008 redesign.If you have a Mazda dealer near you check out the 3 hatch. It has almost as much room and extra year of warranty. Plus you get the better platform the '08 Focus will be on. "

That's too bad, the Focus is a very neat car. I put 54k on my 04 ZX3, loved that little car. I drove it in everything, snow, ice storms, nothing bothered that car. My only regrets with Zippy is that I didn't get a wagon and I didn't get pwr stuff, a/c, and cruise. Zippy was darn near as base as they came, only option was ABS brakes. Had I gotten the options on it I think I would still have it. They are fun as heck to drive!I might check out the Mazda just for grins, let's see if I can get away with dragging hubby car shopping.......*snicker*. :P "
"nippononly","May 2007"," I don't think the '08 Focus will be on the Euro-Focus platform that the Mazda3 is built on, will it? The '08 is just a new plastic face and an options and body style reconfiguration. The Focus that is expected to actually be reengineered is the 2010 Focus. "
"akangl","May 2007"," To look at this logically. I don't think going back to a small car is going to be something I'll be happy about for very long. So, I've switched gears in my internet car shopping to small SUVs and minivans. Looking at all of them online I've narrowed it to the CR-V and the Odyssey. Totally different I know, but I'm trying to decide if I want to keep my 7 pass seating or if 5 will do. Kids are older and have friends......thus the concern, lol.Hubby's been sort of *window* shopping with me and he said if we are going to buy something that there are conditions on it. 1. I have to wait until fall 2. it has to at least scrape the 30 mpg mark for hwy mileage 3. it has to have good resale value and 4. I have to sell the Durango on my own.Gives me hope that maybe I won't be stuck with the Durango forever! I should be able to get close to what I paid for it I'd imagine, its in the low enough price range where it should be easy to sell. Downside to it is the gas mileage and the cost of gas......*grumble* "

I NEED a good reliable work vehicle to haul my equipment around in, so a van or a truck is absolutely neccassary for me. Nissan is planning on putting diesels into some of their N.A. vehicles in 2010 I believe, so I'll be interested in that. "

I like to dicker, perhaps split the dealers profits in half, knowing the dealer's invoice,taking all the incentives, kickbacks, etc., into consideration and when the price is set, write a cheque or finance for 2 or 3 years.

Don't be so perplexed... motorhome life is not so 'inefficient'... we have a very small space to heat and cool which saves utilities compared to a home. And, I don't see it as wasting enormous amounts of fuel. I have the new 'clean air diesel' which eliminates about 90% of the pollutants.

Used to just trade it in but last time he had two friends (I was one of them) all set to buy it instead. Since this guy is really anal about things I know everything has been maintained and he'll tell me anything that he thought was coming up.I missed the last one. The other guy jumped first.

For most of a year I was a good boy, and knocked out a few things in what was my 4th year in the last 14 that I had more cars than payments. Then came the spring of 2007... and now that I was taking a road bike with me to a few places, a 2-door Accord was really getting to be a pain. Most of what I shopped (Forester, RAV4, fleeting glances at the WRX wagon, RDX and CX-7 seemed too pricey, couldn't find an Outback XT near me) had represented some kind of compromise, and I was about to table the whole thing for at least a few months.

That car listed for about $22,000 new I would guess. So, a five year old Honda bringing almost half price with over 100,000 miles seems like a strong price compared to other makes/models. Also, her car looks like it has no more that 50k... I was surprise how clean it was inside and out. She loves the CR-V!Looks like the CR-V fits right in the middle between a sedan and a mini-van.

I only owe $3200 on it, so with the 120% factored in, I've got some major equity to play with.I could do one of two things ...1) Use the equity as a down payment and finance.2) Use the equity to start a cheap lease (3 yr, 15K miles) and get a check back for the difference.There are 17 different dealers, selling pretty much every make, foreign and domestic.I went on-line with them and had their website do a valuation of my trade .. they came back with a range of $7400 to $9200.

When I was first talking to the owner on the phone, and asked him how much he was wanting, I almost did a double-take when he said he only wanted $500! Had to stop myself before blurting out ""Is that all?!"". Which, I guess, wouldn't have been the smartest thing in the world to do! One of my friends stopped by today to look at it, and I drove him around the block. I asked my roommated if he wanted to go along, and he just said ""No, I'll just stay here, so you can call me in case you break down!"". Some vote of confidence, I guess. :surprise: To be fair though, he did see it start to show its cranky side up in PA. We stopped by to see Grbeck, who's nearby. We all piled in to go out to lunch in it, and before I started up I made a reference to Mama's Family. I was thinking about when she bought that Nova, the whole family piled in, and it self-destructed as she pulled away from the curb! Well, naturally, as soon as I said that, it refused to start! I finally got it to fire up by spraying some carb/choke cleaner down in it, and we went out to a nearby diner. I got a little nervous though as we drove off, thinking to myself, okay, is this still close enough that we could run back and get one of the other cars, just in case?Thankfully, it did fire up when we left the diner, and it seems like the more I've been driving it, the less cranky it is. The seller did say that it was hardly ever driven, though. He drove it maybe 15 miles between last year's inspection and this year's!It has about 63,800 miles on it, and mechanically it feels like it'll go on forever. But the interior is showing its age.

"steine13","May 2007"," Daryl,I hear you about your 'addiction'. But you have to realize, we're not that kind of support group.The only thing I can think of is get something you really like. Or get into a two-year lease, which pretty much forces you to stick with a car for two years. It can also be a great deal with the right manufacturer support.Or a nightmare, if you change jobs and mile up a car you don't own.Other than that, buy cheap cars (that's my solution) that hold their value fairly well. Or buy stuff you won't be able to replace easily, like the last model of a car where the redesign is not to your liking -- the '03 Solara would be an example, lots of people don't want the new, swoopy one. Getting into a 0% loan, which you can do again on some cars, is also good, because then trading before most of it is paid of is ""stupid"" in that you're giving up the incentive. But don't listen to me, I once paid a 0% loan off early cuz I hated making payments... I must be some kind of financial genius...FWIW, I've bought cars brand new, driven them for a couple years, and gotten out for $100/month and 10c/mile. It does involve buying heavily incentivized but decent cars ('97 Nissan truck) or using my GM Card rebates (Prizm, Vibe, Silverado).You may take comfort in the fact that most of us here know exactly of what you speak.Except akangl, who is still looking at your post and scratching her blond head, wondering what alleged problem you're talking about ;-)Good luck,-Mathias "

Yeah, the paint looks like it'll shine up just fine. I wet my fingers and rubbed at a spot on the hood and the decklid, and once the oxydization came off, the paint underneath still looked deep, with plenty of lustre.As for fuel economy, I'm sure it's going to guzzle just like my other '79 NYer. But it didn't seem to do too bad coming back from PA. It had just over a half-tank when we started it up on Saturday. Between test driving, goofing around up there, bringing it home, and driving it a bit down here, I've probably put at least 150 miles on it. But now the gas gauge is down to a little over a quarter-tank. These things have 21 gallon tanks, so on the surface that sounds like it would be pretty economical. But I have yet to see a gas gauge that's actually linear, in true correlation to what's actually in the tank! I've been able to get my other '79 down into the single digits, and never broke 14-15 on the highway, so I'm not expecting this ""new"" one to do any better. About the only real difference I can think of between the two is the tires. My 5th Ave has 235/70/R15 Firestone Firehawks that are pretty grippy (and pretty worn-down), and mounted on 15x7 copcar rims. This new one just has generic big-car whitewall tires, a 225/75/R15, and they look like they're mounted on narrower rims, like maybe a 6"" rim?

"perna","May 2007"," IMO, Garmin makes the best portable GPS devices. You can't go wrong with any of 'em, just pick the one that has the features you like. The best deals are the ones that come with the entire US/Canada map built into it. Otherwise, you have to buy a bigger memory module to avoid constantly loading and reloading maps, which is around $100. "
"qbrozen","May 2007"," well, as i mentioned on the nav board (  ), I'm very interested in the HP rx915. Currently has a $50 rebate, I might add. I just think getting a portable nav that can also function as a pocket PC is worth a few more bucks. I mean, heck, you can save your address book or, better yet, save web pages (or access the internet on the fly with a bluetooth web-enabled phone) and get addresses right then and there and plug them into the nav. pretty darned neat.

"jefferyg","May 2007"," Hey guys and ladies! I had to take a break from posting for a while and do some real work for a change, but I have not forgotten all your happy (and sometimes not so happy) bantering, and I thought I'd give you an update on my recent tradings. First of all, my wife and I recently completed the adoption of our two children. They had been in our home as foster children since April of 2004. The funny thing is that it took less time in court to finalize the adoption than it does to buy a new vehicle. However, the paperwork just keeps coming.Anyway, since I last posted here we've had major changes in the automotive scene at our house. In January we traded the Passat for an Odyssey EX-L with RES. I used to be adamantly opposed to having a minivan, but now that we have one, I'm hooked. How does anyone live without one? The Ody is silky-smooth, whisper quiet, and Beth loves it.Trade #2 for 2007 came last month. With rising gas prices, I decided to trade the F-150 SuperCrew for an 07 Civic. I was in really good shape on the truck so I paid no money down and lowered my monthly payment by $100. I also cut my fuel costs by more than half. I kinda wish I'd have gone with the Si, but I didn't want another black interior, and Beth loathes driving a stick, so I got the EX in Tango Red Pearl. With gas at over $3 a gallon Beth has been driving the car a lot more, and I've been driving...Vehicle #3. After trading the truck I needed something to knock around in, pull a small utility trailer, go get gas for the mower, haul the kids to ballgames, etc. I found a 1994 Explorer XLT with 120,000 miles on it. Super clean, leather interior, quite a few dings in the paint but nothing major, and I was able to get it at a reasonable price. A/C had been reworked about 2 years ago and it has brand new tires and shocks. A friend of mine fixed the rear power windows for me, and I put a new stereo head-unit in it. So far it's doing great, but time will tell.Anyway, three vehicles in less than five months is a new record for me. Yall have a great day! "

Yeah, I dug on the Civic SI, liked the exhaust note and the power but I am not so sure I am liking the revs to get to the power. I am used to it somewhat, I have done HPDEs in an ITR, regular GSRs and previous Civic SIs. On a track its easy to keep the revs up, on the street its a little more challenging.I am also looking at the Speed6 (my first choice but I cant afford it) and the WRX (lacks the refinement of the Honda, but the turbo is a hoot, I like AWD, and the aftermarket has already embraced it). I think in reality, I am going to end up with a Civic LX/EX or Mazda3/Focus ST.I think the anti-minivan sediment is funny. I would definitely rather have a minivan than a station wagon on stilts (SUV). Of course, I would rather have a regular station wagon than a minivan so we have an awd/5spd wagon. "

It bothers the heck out of his back.Unfortunatly the only car we found that was comfortable for him was the Altima, but after an extended test drive my back said NO WAY!The Durango is a comfy beast, the seats are great, can drive it for 12 hrs and not get sore.

"qbrozen","May 2007"," if his leg hits up against the center console its a no goOh, I totally agree. That's the one measurement I make sure of when choosing a car. But that's not a problem with the power seat in the Accord. Or pretty much any power seat. Reason being that the power seat allows you to tilt the front of the bottom cushion up and the rear down, thereby supporty my thighs and keeping them from having the tilt to the sides and rest against the console and door.

"guss","May 2007"," I am 6'6"" and hands down the most comfortable seating position of any car I owned was my Durango. It had the power seats to tilt for additional legroom.The Mazda6 also is very comfortable because it has the telescoping steering wheel you ca go way back and angle the seat back and still reach the steering wheel. Fuel mileage is not as good as the Accord though. Did you try the Civic when you were at the Honda dealer ? The way the center console is laid out I had plenty of room. "
"jefferyg","May 2007"," I agree with you about the leg room in the Civic. I just wish my EX had a power seat and adjustable lumbar. The seat is not uncomfortable, but I don't know if I'd want to go all day in it.If comfort is what you want, it's really hard to beat the seating position in a minivan, Mid to large sized SUV, or a full-size pickup, especially if they have a power seat.Honestly, of the vehicles I've owned, the 94 Explorer with power leather seats is one of the most comfortable I've experienced.

The models rated in CR all have mediocre-to-abysmal reliability records. (Sorry, I don't mean to rag on your car brand of choice).You talked about buying a Subie before--is that still a possibility? I'd say, your question all depends on the details: what you'd buy, & what you'd get for your Saturn (duh). I guess if you're only gonna get $3k, for a 60K mile car, you should keep it, unless it's in the shop a lot & costing you what the payments on a new car w/warranty would be.Probably no help, but that's my best shot..... "
"michaellno","June 2007"," ... by the comments so far.Here's the financial breakdown ...I owe about $2800 on the Saturn at the moment, but KBB values it at between $7500-9000 (trade in, not retail). Not sure what someone would give me for it in trade; haven't gotten that far, but I suspect that there is, at the very least, a few thousand in equity to play with.I had to put about $1800 into the car a little over a year ago (brakes and a BCM), but since then it's been smooth sailing. I need to get the transmission serviced, but that's about it for anything over and above regular maintenance.boom: therein lies the problem -- what to get? As woody pointed out, I did look at an Outback a few months ago. Nice car, and, with a new model coming out in '08, some pretty decent deals to be made on the '07's.But, but, but .. there really isn't anything about my car I don't like. V6, power everything, leather. I'm finding it hard to think of anything else I could replace it with that A) I can afford; and  does things better than my current ride.I know I've been down this path with this group before, and I've stayed put. I like the idea of having the car paid off (much like andre and his Intrepid), and using the money in other ways.Decisions, decisions.EDIT: funny, but the thought of getting an Aura hasn't crossed my mind.

"steine13","June 2007"," ""I had to put about $1800 into the car a little over a year ago (brakes and a BCM), but since then it's been smooth sailing.""BCM = ""Body Control Module"".It's a lousy design; they pretty much all go bad. The reason I know what it stands for is a friend of mine had the 4cyl wagon, and the same thing happened to him. He got lucky though, car was still under warranty.This would grind me to no end, it's a lousy design and it should never fail, or at least they should stand behind it. The other thing my buddy didn't like was absolutely lousy fuel economy with the 4cyl; 27 mpg was good. 23 was normal. I don't think he ever saw 30, no matter what he tried. He got fed up with it pretty quickly -- he had inherited it from his Dad when he could no longer drive -- and sold it to the local Saturn dealer. Good riddance.Oh yeah, and the power locks sometimes decided not to work at all, or just unlock in the parking lot, or just lock while he was driving along... and no key cylinder on the passenger side, so that was no good when the remote wouldn't work. Dumb stuff like that.The Jetta wagon is set to come out next year, but who knows if it's any better reliability-wise. Why oh why can't we have the Euro Accord wagon....? I don't much like Subarus; the AWD is more in the way of a gimmick, and it takes a lot of extra fuel and maintenance.

The Legacy wagon (which returns 29 mpg, or 31 by the trip computer), even with the crummy RE-92s, seems to deal with snow better than the Civic with Blizzaks, especially while getting underway. Even yesterday in the rain, the car felt very stable even with a lot of standing water on the road (something that would trip up the Civic, even with new tires).I have been very pleased with it, pricing was very agressive, oh and its a wagon!!

"woodyww","June 2007"," Since I have the memory of a Kumquat, what are the details of your Legacy wagon, trim level, etc., & what did you pay, if you don't mind?I knew a woman with an AWD Subaru wagon who slid into another car on a snowy country road when she couldn't stop (with the stock tires). I suggested getting 4 snows & wheels from the Tire Rack, which went nowhere.My RWD 5-series wagon was actually quite decent in moderate surburban snow when I had Michelin Arctic Alpins on it, & the traction control was on a fair amount. I now have a set of Dunlop Winter Sport M3's I hope to get mounted by next winter. But I might trade it on a Subaru if I moved to VT or lived on a dirt road in Maine. My Range Rover, with the stock summer or ""all weather"" tires, was surprisingly mediocre in snow (in 4wd). Really bad.

"lilengineerboy","June 2007"," The very base model '05 Legacy 2.5i wagon/stick, was just about 20k (I think slightly under, then slightly over OTD). Its not the turbo model and its fine with 1 or 2 people but gets a little pokey with a full load of passengers. It gets called upon to tow small trailers relatively often and it does that fine. HWY mileage is in the high 20s/low 30s. I found the seats comfortable and I like the ergonomics of the cabin.I keep trying to come up with my biggest complaint and I can't think of one - eh maybe its geared a little off with too big of a jump between 3rd 4th and 5th. You can't downshift to 3rd for passing/merging at highway speed, and 4th doesn't quite get it done. The turbo would alleviate that issue entirely I am sure.I think it feels more coarse than the Honda or Toyota because of the boxer motor, but I like it personally. "
"steine13","June 2007"," Alright, I was probably a little harsh on the Legacy.That I don't want one is more a case of sour grapes.. I WOULD like one, but I can't justify it; my 'commute' is only 2.3 miles and it's in-town, so what's the point... and my wife needs a minivan for her business, so if you have that already, then an alternate vehicle should be a Vibe or Matrix rather than a Legacy. It IS a cool car, though.

I went to my mom's house about 11:30 and went back to the dealership at 4:30. The truck was ready at 5, so I'm thinking, ok, they fixed everything......WRONG!In that time the ONLY thing they replaced was the rack and pinion and did an alignment (if you want to call it that). The truck is worse than before, steering wheel isn't centered anymore, and the steering is horribly stiff (course that could just be because I was used to all the slop it had before).I took it back to them about the steering wheel, their response, well, leave it here overnight and we'll fix it in the morning......uh, I live 100 miles away! So, for now I'm living with it, they had to order parts for everything else, so it still squeaks and clunks, only now it doesn't go straight down the road, ugh. It'll probably go back in a couple weeks after the parts get in.Its getting harder and harder to live with the Durango, its a good little truck, runs great, but the service dept just makes me cringe. :sick: Honda CR-V is looking better all the time!

It wasn't much better, it had a lot of fuel system problems, it left us in Washington with a blown injector, was never right after it was fixed.

Seemed silly to pay all that money for it to sit, we got a really good trade in for it considering the body damage and such that it had.Hindsight, I should have traded it for a new SUV of some assorts, maybe a CR-V or something like that rather than the Durango. The Durango was cheap and I figured it wouldn't be bad to live with for a year or so. I'm trying to make the year mark, lol, would be best if I could since I'll most likely have it paid off by then and can sell it.Its not terrible to live with and hopefully when they finally get everything fixed it'll be a little better.

Anyway, this sucker was dead by 1989. It had already had the engine and transmission replaced, and when tranny #2 went out, it got put out of its misery.

"qbrozen","June 2007"," I'm only heating/cooling mine in extreme weather. The heating and cooling takes place with either 2 tiny electric space heaters or a window AC unit.It is an attached 2-car, but its attached via the laundry room (or mud room or whatever you wanna call it), so it doesn't actually contact the full 2-story dwelling. It does have insulation in the walls, but not the attic (something I really should remedy). And, no, my doors aren't insulated either. It didn't even occur to me that they might have something like insulated garage doors. If they do, I might have to look into that. At the same time, I could get ones that go straight up to accomodate the lift discussed earlier. Neither the heaters nor AC unit do a great job, but it makes it much easier to work out there than if I didn't have them at all. The heaters I put right in the immediate area I'll be working. The AC unit has a remote, so I just stick my hand in the door in the morning and turn it on, that way the garage is somewhat cool from the night before to begin with and the AC just has to keep it that way through the midday sun. I would say I use the heating and cooling maybe 4 days a year each.

The garage is barely worth saving, but I don't want to spend $25K for a new 2 car garage, when the house itself is marginal & may be a ""tear down"" when I sell it.So I need to get a roofing estimate or 2, & a couple of garage door estimates. And I hate to jump into getting the door replaced, given the condition of the roof, altho it's really the door that's preventing me from parking my car in garage. Being a cheapskate tho, if it's more that a couple of $$thou total, I may just let it go.....It's amazing how much better an old one-car garage is, than no garage tho. "
"andre1969","June 2007"," If your garage is really shot, you might want to look into some of those pre-fabricated garages where they build it in a warehouse and truck it out to your lot. They don't sit on a permanent foundation. You just have to make sure that the place where it's going to be located is level. My neighbor had a similar building put in that she actually uses as a sort of pavilion for when she has parties, but it's the same basic structure. Her's is basically a 12x24 garage with one of the long ends opened up to the pool. She had hers put down on gravel, but you might be able to get away with setting one down on the existing concrete slab of the old garage.I think one of those types of garages might go for about $5,000.Here's the website for the company that built my garage: http://www.durabiltpolebuildings.com/ Maybe they could do something for you. Just keep in mind that their prices don't include a concrete floor; that's something you'd have to have a local contractor do. Still, I thought my garage was pretty reasonable. I think I'm into mine about $28-30,000 so far for a 24x40, but that also included a lot of grading to the yard, having an engineer beef up the foundation at the county's request, and having A LOT of gravel trucked in. The area I had my garage built was low, so they put a lot more gravel than usual under the slab, but I also had to have about 200 feet of driveway put in. I would've been happy just driving over the grass to park the cars in it, but the county said no. Which in all honesty, is probably for the best. During a rainy season, the lower part of the yard can get pretty muddy. "
"stever","June 2007"," I'm pretty sure you can retrofit your doors but maybe not as cleanly as getting insulated ones off the bat.Woodyww, my new (double) door cost about $800 a few years ago. The prefab is probably the way to go for lots of y'all - may as well spring for a 6 or 8 car Butler type building for your chronic car buying (you can always tear the house down and put a MIL apartment on top of the garage you know). "
"woodyww","June 2007"," Got my first estimate for a door: $831 installed for a steel ""Wayne-Dalton 8300"" insulated door (""single"" door). Sounds high, like everything around here. The insulation doesn't matter, given the condition & age of the garage.If I could get the roof done for maybe??? $1500? I could justify it. There's a good local GC who specializes in roofing who could maybe do garage doors--?--but I have a feeling that doors are best left to specialists perhaps.The prefab--sounds like a good idea, but in my ""fancy"" Mass. surburban town, everything costs more, there's zoning, seems like no matter what you do, you just have to pay up, & fit in. Given the condition of my house, I'm just trying to do enough frugal repairs to keep it going.....not that I don't have my own grandiose garage fantasies.....One thing I've noticed--even leaving a 6 y.o. bmw outside all the time seems like ""cruel & inhuman"" punishment, & may wreck the paint eventually (duh).

Just follow the instructions. It is like putting a model toy together, all the holes are drilled, etc.On my scale, it is a ""1 friend + 1 six-pack"" job.Actually, if the garage isn't too tall or the roof too steep, that actually isn't too hard to do either.

She had a pro come out and fix it.I just checked my garage, which has two single doors (9x7 I think) and it has a metal rod over each door, kinda like a long shower curtain rod. It has cables that wind up around it. I'm guessing there's a spring inside the rod that coils up?

Front brakes are a miserable job, but out side of that, the cars are pretty easy to work on and maintain.I would make sure the timing belt has been changed (and the waterpump) as well as the counterbalance shaft and cam seals.

Sitting on 114K.AC blew cold, although that is something I would trade off for $$! The kid can sweat.Nearly new Michelins, a plus. Brakes felt fine.

Needs a serious detail, but nothing a couple of hours elbow grease wouldn't fix.Paint faded, and there were an assortment of dents. Biggest problem was some rust, along the bottom of the DS rear fender (below the gas cap, where it meets the bumper). That side of the bumber wasn't holding on by much.On the plus side, the kids father is a BMW technician who did all the work on it. Would have to speak to him to see what was (and wasn't) done.Price was 1,600, but the Mom (who showed it) said it was definitely negotiable (they are ready to have it gone from outside the house).Tempted to low ball on it, although I don't really need something for a while yet.

Right now I've zeroed in on a pristine 1997 Dakar II M3 coupe with only 45K on the clock. Manual Vaders, heated seats, just beautiful- and owned by an obsessive-compulsive car nut who is only selling it because his wife says he can't keep that AND a Z4 AND a Triumph Bonnie.And then look what pops up...UH-OH! :surprise: "
"stickguy","June 2007"," Yeah, in theory an old Accord is going to be more reliabe. But that doesn't mean things wont break. Especially if it was ignored early on.That's one problem with some Hondas. They have the reputation as indestructible, and some owners take that to mean no maintenance.So, you get a car with 115K on it with original hoses, belts, fluids, etc. Vs the Volvo, where the previous owner replaced all of the consumables!Also, there is a difference between a cheap starter car for a 16 YO, and something I would want for myself. All kinds of things could crap out on the kids car and they wouldn't need to be fixed. Not for me though "
"qbrozen","June 2007"," Don't confuse durability with reliability.oh, i'm not confusing anything. i mean, you are right in a sense that just because a car has gone 200k miles doesn't mean its been reliable.But, I also speak from personal experience. I've had Hondas and volvos (along with about a dozen other makes).I think where people also get confused is the level to which a car is cared for. example:""my $40k volvo has a rattling noise coming from the dash after just 50k miles! What an unreliable piece of junk!""or""my $16k honda has a rattling noise coming from the dash after just 20k miles. eh. Whattya expect for $16k? at least it doesn't leave me stranded.""in other words, people expect more from more expensive cars. Just read the owners boards and you'll see what I mean. I notice alot more people complaining viciously about tiny inconsequential stuff on more expensive cars. And I think this is connected to stickguy's comment, too. Alot of Honda owners buy Hondas because they don't want to bother taking care of a vehicle. That would also apply to taking it to the dealer to complain of little issues. My Accord with just 16k miles is making all kinds of creaks and rattles, but its a lease and its relatively inexpensive, so I just don't care enough to do anything about it. On the other hand, when I had my volvo, every little noise bothered me and I had to chase it down. replacing suspension parts, etc, along the way. "
"michaellno","June 2007"," I made it to California unscathed and without incident. Two more tanks of gas .. one in Vegas (almost 33 mpg) and another in Victorville (just under 30 mpg). Just over 1100 miles total and averaged around 31.5 mpg for the trip.Not one single problem along the way. I have to say that after this experience, my admiration for Subarus has gone up considerably. It's very possible that the next car I get will be a Subaru.My son is thrilled to have a car .. now all he needs is his license. We did take it to a parking lot where I started to instruct him in the intricacies of driving a stick. Yes, he stalled it a bunch of times, but he's getting the hang of it.It was nice to have a road trip, but I have to admit that I'm very glad to be flying home!stickguy - good luck with that Accord.

He focused quite a bit on the safety aspects of the car.Wife was very impressed; she said she liked it both as a driver and as a passenger. I thought it was pretty nice too, certainly an upgrade from the L300. Wife was surprised that I liked the wagon style; she was certain that I'd gravitate towards another sedan.I'm having the sales guy do some preliminary numbers for me - we'll see what he comes up with before going further.Found that the Volvo is actually 4"" shorter than the Saturn, so it'll fit in the garage nicely. And, the insurance on it would only be $16 more per month than what I'm paying on the Saturn. "

"akangl","June 2007"," To drive an 07 CR-V. Neat little SUV, very peppy which surprised me. My Durango has a V8 and feels very sluggish, the CR-V's 4-cyl felt like it had more ponies, but it doesn't. Seats were comfortable, driving position very nice, but, the dead pedal is in a bad place, seems like all Hondas and Toyotas are that way. Its liveable, but very different from the Durango. Seats were a little short on thigh support, but not too bad. Legroom in the rear was amazing, much more than the Durango.However, I'm not sure that gas mileage will be all that great with all the hills we have around here. The Durango can average between 16-18 mpg, it struggles in the hills, lots of hunting in the transmission. Seems very underpowered for a V8, maybe its the gearing.Overall I was pretty impressed with the CR-V, I think Honda did a good job. They could have deadened up the road noise a bit more, but turning up the stereo fixes that.

To me, if I am getting a ""practical"" car (like my Accord) I am just going to buy it. If I decide to lease, I want to splurge on something nicer than I would normally buy (like the Volvo), because I can!For a lease, I end up comparing payments (adjusting for inception cash), and sometimes the difference between a basic car and something nice isn't really that much.The Volvo does has the best seast around, all the bells and whistles, lots of room, and every safety feature I can think of.

I don't like them either and I think in general they are placed much too low on the car. They distort whatever it is you are looking at because they are down by the bumper or number plate. "

Maybe its just my bad left knee (3 surgeries and mild arthritis) that causes me to be sensitive to it. Its ok, but I was concerned that on long trips I would have a problem because I can't stretch that leg out all the way. The only vehicle I've ever owned that had the perfect dead pedal was the Titan, that was the most comfortable truck for me to drive. I still miss it terribly. The Durango really doesn't have one and the CR-V seemed a little short. *sigh* If only the Titans got better gas mileage.......I have a hard time driving hubby's Ram, its a 6-spd manual and I have to sit very far forward to be able to convince my left knee that it can handle the pressure of the clutch. My right knee rests on the brake controller. After a day of driving it I'm hurting bad. Been hauling horses all week so have been spending all my time in the Ram........just wish it was an automatic.As for the back up sensors, cameras, and all that, never owned a vehicle with them. I've only backed into one thing and that was a log that was laying down, didn't see it and misjudged the length of the first Titan I had. Truck was 5 days old, mangled the trailer wiring but otherwise didn't hurt it.*now that I brag about it I'm sure I'll back hubby's Ram and horse trailer into something today*  "

"mark156","June 2007"," I know this is a little off topic but it's about cars!British Rover... I read in the London Sunday Times... front page article... (in brief)..""Ford Hires KPMG for Jaguar exit."" ""Ford had recruited the accountancy group KPMG to examine the books at Jaguar and Land Rover, two of Britains best-known car companies, ahead of an expected 1 billion (pound sterling) sale later this year."" ""Despite mounting speculation in recent weeks, Ford has declined to confirm it will sell the famous marques. But the appointment of KPMG, which has been given a mandate to revamp the companies' accounts so that they are in a proper form to be examined by would-be buyers, appears to make a sale inevitable. The story goes on to say that.. ""Last year The Sunday Times revealed that Ford planned to sell the two firms as a single unit. The sale was shelved while Aston Martin, another British marque, was auctioned.""In a nut shell, everything is speculation. :confuse: So, for you folks going to the UK.... take your money as it takes $2 to buy 1 pound. Which makes everything double! Fuel appeared to sell for $8 a gallon. Mark156  "
"guss","June 2007"," if Volvo will be next in the fire sale.I hope Ford makes it, I have always liked their trucks and SUVs. If they have done one thing well over the past 20 years it's their big vehicles. They need to bring some of their european mainstream cars over here like GM is doing with Saturn. Maybe give Mercury that job. With that exchange rate we should be seeing alot of British coming over here for vacations. "
"qbrozen","June 2007"," I wonder if volvo will be next in the fire saleas we've discussed on the boards around here, that's very unlikely. Volvo and Land Rover are the only brands under the Ford umbrella that are in the black. The only reason Land Rover is even being sold is because nobody wants Jaguar by itself. So LR is being sacrificed. Unless they decide to unload Lincoln or Mercury and package volvo with it as the incentive, I doubt they are going anywhere.  "
"british_rover","June 2007"," Exactly...You would probably have to pay someone to take jag off your hands or at least that is the common perception in the press. They have strong brand equity and some great manufacturing facilities in the UK but their lineup is in pretty dismal shape currently. They probably have slight positive value but not much.Ford can't afford to pay anyone to take Jag of their hands like Daimler did with Chrysler so they have to bundle another brand with it.Land Rover and Jag are the same company under the skin now. They share engines, factories, transmissions, electronics, marketing and design facilities. A lot of the people that I work with at Land Rover have dual roles with Jag as well.Ford seems to be doing everything it can to save its core North American operations. In the case of Land Rover they are almost cutting off their nose to spite their face. If Ford was a private company with more cash reserves I can see them trying to consolidate their North American operations into the profitable units and spinning off all of Mercury and most of Lincoln. They don't have the time or resources to do that.I now think Ford will most likely sell Jag and LR but they would be stupid to not retain 20-30 percent interest in both companies. "

So, I figured it was ok. Went to the store, turned to pull into a parking space and sure enough its still creaking and popping. Thought ok, I can live with that, no big deal. Headed home through the hills and all seemed fine until I got down on the flat, had the cruise control set and sure enough the engine started surging again. It surges 300-500 rpms, sometimes worse.I can deal with a lot of things, but an incompetent service department wasting my time is NOT on that list. :mad: Never again will I own a Chrysler product. This is by far the worst I've ever dealt with, even the Titan was easier than this. :sick: "

I stopped over and spoke with the salesguy, he understood how I felt. He just said to give him a call when we are ready and he's sure he'll have the right CR-V on his lot. I told him I want good gas mileage, safety, and reliability. He said ""well, the CR-V fits all those and it has great resale value"" Then he snickered and said ""not like you (laugh) will be getting rid of it or anything"" LOL, he's known me for a while.I told hubby if he wants to keep the Durango then its HIS problem from now on. He said just stick it out until September and we'll sell it. He thinks the CR-V is a good choice and the honda dealership has a nice service dept (dealt with them when I had a subaru).All in all I'm ready to scream, I hate wasting time, it irritates the heck out of me.

Last I checked, a local dealer was offering $1K off of MSRP. Not great, but they're popular.And have they given you a trade-in price on the durango? I don't know that I'd wait 'til Sept given all the problems--that is, if the Honda dealer gives you a great deal on your trade, etc. etc.Is the Pilot idea still a possibility? When I went to check out the CR-V, the salesman was going on about what great deals they had on the Pilot, so a Pilot ""wouldn't cost much more than a CR-V"", but I didn't get into specifics. "

I'll sell it on my own in September/October timeframe, mainly because of the permenant fund dividend checks and winter coming. I think it will sell easily for $9ish which is a whole lot more than its worth in trade.On another note, I called the Dodge dealer this morning to let them know its still not fixed. Service advisor put me on hold, then came back, said bring it in Monday and they will put me in a rental. I'm sure he went to the service manager who is well aware of the situation.I'm not sure I'm going to replace the Durango right away after its sold.

"nippononly","June 2007"," Aint that the rub? I say go for the stretch into the TL, otherwise you will regret it in a year or two. I have always regretted when I have bought a car that met my needs perfectly adequately but left me reminiscing all the time about the more expensive car I could also have had that would have met my needs AND been a whole lot more fun, for not much more money. Of course, the price diff between the Accord and the TL is fairly substantial, so maybe that logic doesn't apply here...gosh, I think I am still addicted! What's the point of this group??!! :-P "

What was that a stretch from, a Kia Rio ?I agree to stretch, but my idea of stretching is getting the options I want.

"nippononly","June 2007"," No right now I am on my minimalist kick, and the Echo fits that theme perfectly! :-)The way I figure it there will never be another production car sold with such a low curb weight, except a $50K dedicated sportster like the Lotus. And I don't have to worry about ever repairing anything, because there's nothing in it to break! Funny thing is, I'm almost two years into this minimalist thing with no abatement so far. That's surprising. Yet it only influences my choice of car type, not the overall size of my fleet (currently at 4, soon to be 3 again, but still not exactly a minimalist number for a single guy). So I still need to attend CCBA meetings! :-PPS What I said was true though: in the past I have regretted not getting the swish model I wanted and settling for the plain wrapper sensible alternative. It has influenced me in trading a couple of cars early. So I say go for it! :-) "
"woodyww","June 2007"," According to cars.com, their ""target price"" for a TL (non-S, no NAV), is $32,614. For a 4dr Sedan 3.0 EX w/Auto (no NAV), it's $25,255.You get a longer warranty with the TL, Xenons!, & I think (?) the stereo may be a lot better.....and supposedly the resale is truly excellent. I'd go for the TL in a heartbeat.Unless you decided to go for a more basic Accord, 4 cyl., no lthr., in the low $20's, & saved at least $10K vs. the TL--hard to argue with that. "

"dad23","June 2007"," If your spouse ""lets you"", LOL, she keeps saying get what you want, but I know what that means!I was looking at the Accord EX-L V6 and the base TSX sedans. The TL would be nice, but I can't see putting out the extra $$ right now. We've got three starting preschool on the next few months among other expenses we have and are about to put out. I guess the thing I like more about the TSX is I don't see tons of them everyday like the Accord. "
"guss","June 2007"," I think you hit the nail on the head, the TSX is still an uncommon car around here.Plus everything is just a bit nicer over the Accord.

"michaellno","June 2007"," So, where have you been shopping?I was at Mile High Acura a week or two ago and test drove the TSX. I will admit that it didn't do too much for me, but perhaps that is because I drove an automatic. Seemed to hunt between gears quite a bit. The test drive was Havana to Hampden to Yosemite to 225 to Parker Road.Salesman was also off-putting. Young and eager, which I suppose are good things, but I just didn't seem to 'click' with him.I think (and this will come as no surprise to anyone) that I'm going to stand pat with the Saturn. As much as I liked the Volvo, I couldn't justify having more payments over and above the 6 left it will take to pay off the Saturn.Plus, the wife is going back to school in the fall, so the extra cash flow of not having payments will help in that arena as well.Every time I drive the Saturn, I think about what would be better and/or different about a new car that would cause me to get back into debt again, and I realize that, for me, the Saturn does pretty much everything well -- decent power, lots of features, good trunk space, adequate mileage for a V6.The only real complaint about it -- and this is from the wife -- is that it's very low to the ground. Well, compared to her VUE, most everything is! She finds it hard to get into and out of.So, for now, everything is status quo. "

"dad23","July 2007"," Yes, it is the V6, and honestly, I have no idea why I'm making this so hard to decide. I wanted the Accord all along but then was presented with the TSX lease and it seems like such a nice vehicle with some added benefits, but if I were to be practical, the Accord would do just fine. I guess it doesn't help that a good friend of ours said the Accord was a grandpa car :surprise: The other dilemna is that a friend of mine who works at one of the dealerships traded for the color I want, which no one seems to have. As my wife says, just you know what or get off the pot!!! "
"lilengineerboy","July 2007"," I was under the impression that the US Accord is bigger than the EuroAccord/TSX.

"british_rover","July 2007"," The american accord is a good bit bigger then the TSX which is just the euro accord for the US market.The TL is the acura version of the US accord with different styling, suspension and engine tuning. "
"dad23","July 2007"," I think the Accord is longer and wider, they're the same height and the TSX has less than an inch more room in the back seat than the Accord. We have three guys still in car seats, the big Britax ones, which is what the Odyssey is for. But I agree, it'd be nice if they could make them smaller without giving up any safety, so I'm not sure if we could fit three booster seats in either vehicle. "

I wanted to shoot them both. It's a great car tho, & others have praised it.I just read the ""First Drive: 2004 Acura TSX"" on Edmunds (it's still basically the same, right?). It looks so nice from the pics, & they rave about it; the interior, & the ""razor-sharp handling"".To me, it seems a couple of steps up from an Accord.....in a different class really. Maybe you should read that Edmunds review, if you haven't? I vote for the TSX. "

"stickguy","July 2007"," nice choice. I really debated between that and the Accord I did buy (EX-L 5 speed)The Accord does IMO have a bigger back seat. Not sure how much wider, but no mid size car like this is going to handle 3 big honking car seats most likely.In my case, the price differential on the car I got (a left over) was too great to pass up. I think it was close to 6K at the time (IIRC). And the TSX didn't really have much that I could honestly say I missed in content (or more accurately, the Accord had everything I required!)A little cash on suspension upgrades would close the gap even more. THough I did really like the seats in the TSX! "

Driving a 2007 PT Cruiser convertable, had about 350 miles on it when I picked it up today. Kind of a cool car to have on an 80+ degree day, but not so cool when it comes to getting groceries.Not sure when I'm getting the Durango back, hopefully some time this week.

That and the fact that the GSM is a very good friend of ours  They have triplet girls who were born a day after our boys, so we do a lot with them and he cut me a pretty good deal. The difference between the Accord and TSX lease payment was only $31/month. I got the carbon gray pearl with quart leather, automatic, no navi.

The Pilot was my first choice, but its quite a bit more $$$ than the CR-V and the gas mileage isn't as good. The only things I need to haul in my vehicle is groceries (every 2 weeks) and about 150 lbs of bagged horse feed (every 2 weeks). Other than that its pretty much just a run around for me and the kids.I did learn really fast yesterday that you can't fit much into the ""trunk"" of a PT Cruiser convertable. Had to forgo horse feed and hope I can squeak by for a bit longer until I get the Durango back.On another note, the little PT Cruiser is actually a lot of fun. It has great road manners, is quiet with very little road noise, peppy (although the turbo model is much better), and just seems like a fairly well put together little car. Its a fun little toy, but not good for much else, lol. Gas mileage is mediocre at best, trip computer is reading 21.5 mpg and that's all hwy driving.After this fiasco is over with the Durango if it pulls a stunt like this again I'm done with it. I don't have time to spend sitting at a dealership for hours and hours. Sad thing is I kinda like the Durango. "
"fezo","July 2007"," I had one yesterday as a loaner while they were working on my Ody (routine stuff). An SUV that size is not my cup of tea, but if it were the Pilot is a nice one. This one had the misfortune of being white, which on a vehicle this size gives it the appearance of a marshmallow.If I do move back up into the hills in a couple of years as anticipated I could do worse than having oneof those! "
"woodyww","July 2007"," I do like the exterior looks of the new CR-V (Not everyone agrees). I actually ""notice"" them on the road & check out the colors, etc.--they look more ""upscale"" to me than what they cost. I wouldn't feel too deprived having one in my driveway.I was not so impressed with the interior, which I thought was kind of Plasticky (on an EX-L). But probably as good as a RAV4 or Forester I suppose. "

I'd buy a used one, but they're crazy expensive used.I've never believed that all bmws are Necessarily expensive to repair or trouble-prone; usually the 3's & 5's have pretty good reliability records....Audi's: I'm more afraid of, but they are beautiful, inside & out.....

He had to make one unscheduled maintenance trip to the dealer when a front brake caliper seized up somewhere around the 50K mark. He purchased the extended maintenance package (6 years/100K) and it has paid for itself as he got Inpection II and new rear brakes since the standard 4/50K warranty/maintenance has expired. One of the Angel Eyes recently had to be replaced and one of the rear brake light assemblies has to be replaced (it is on national backorder).We drove the new X5 3.0iA with Sport Package last week and I was impressed to the point that it was hard to realize the fact that I was driving such a heavy vehicle.british_rover: Have you gotten your hands on a new X5 yet?

"akangl","July 2007"," How the heck does that battle get solved?? I want an Armada, but what I need is an SUV that gets me around, so that brings me back to the CR-V. I want/need something very safe, so that leads me to want something bigger than the CR-V.Either way I don't think I'm keeping the Durango, its acting up again, not sure what's wrong this time but the engine keeps wanting to cut out. ARGH!!!I don't want to buy something that I'm going to hate, but I also don't want to buy something that's going to depreciate like a rock either.I'm going to get the Durango fixed......again, and sell it this fall. Then try to figure out what the right vehicle is for me. How do people keep vehicles for 100k+ miles? I think the longest I went was 56k on the Titan.I kind of wish I had kept my Titan, at least I liked it. Last I heard about it was someone at the dodge dealer was going to buy it, then it started acting up, then he wrecked it, not sure what's going on with it now. Only found that out because I ran into the sales manager that did the deal on hubby's dually. He was snickering about the whole thing (he works for Ford now). "
"british_rover","July 2007"," I haven't had a chance to drive a new X5 yet. I did sit in one and do try out all the seats at the local BMW dealership yesterday. It is so much bigger then the sport though so I think a comparison will be tough. The new X5 is 191.1 inches long. That is nearly as long as a Full sized range rover and several inches longer then a Sport.My problem with the X5 is three fold...1. It has zero off-road ability at all so that is a deal killer for me. I actually take vehicles off-road and have been in multiple four wheeling clubs. I know for the vast majority of people that doesn't matter though.2. Yes they do handle very well for a SUV but I think a significant bit of comfort is sacrificed to get that handling. I would rather have the comfort and lose a bit of that handling prowess for a better ride. The 3.0 X5 with the little wheels is better then the V8s with the huge 19 plus inch wheels. The 3.0 is the only one I would be interested in.3. Utility is the last problem I have with the X5. Even as large the X5 has gotten it still has less cargo capacity then the smaller Range Rover sport. The third row is a complete joke and was just put in there as an after thought. Even the jump seats in the back of the old Discos were better. Towing is a bit on the weak side at only 6,000 lbs and with no standard air suspension towing will be harder. I guess all that is why BMW calls then SAVs instead of SUVs. "
"growwise","July 2007"," How do people keep vehicles for 100k+ miles?I wrestled with this question myself. First you should take pride in your vehicle. You've got to like it first. If you dont, then you got yourself an excuse to flip it.Second, you need to be financially savvy. Question is not how much your current ride is worth.. but instead how much is the new ride going to cost you in extra insurance, interest charges and cost+taxes etc. Third, pride in maintenance. I spend a ton of my time on BITOG website. It is very insightful especially if you search the UOA section ( http://theoildrop.server101.com/forums/postlist.php?Cat=0&Board=UBB3 ) and read up on topics like oil, add packs etc.. If there is a coolant leak from a head gasket (high potassium) or air leak in air filter box (high silicon) or bearing wear (high lead) then a UOA will point that out way up front. This allows you to address issues before hand. Last but not the least, keep up the appearance and fix the non powertrain related components such as suspension bits, stereo etc. Some people otoh like to treat minor scratches and dents as badge of honor in the high mileage club. There is nothing like showing off your 250k mile old cars.. People do it all the time (except not on this forum of course silly me). I kind of wish I had kept my TitanI know how you feel. I felt bad for trading in my 115k mile LS2. I wish I had kept it. I maintained the heck out of it and am darn sure it would have kept me going for another 115k no problem. More importantly, it would have saved me big bucks on my new outlander with interest and whatnot. Also, its the attachment and feeling of lack of financial savvyness that invites buyer's remorse. You need to find a new hobby (my new obsession is engine oil not cars even though I keep myself upto date on new product launches and stuff) and that usually takes care of CCBA.Shift your focus off of new cars to how to maintain your existing carKey to maintaining vehicles is as follows:1. Good engine oil (highly debated topic on BITOG) and excellent air and oil filtration (amsoil EaA/EaO or Wix/NapaGold or Donaldson or bypass filter setup etc)2. Brake fluid change every couple years3. Coolant change every couple years4. Tranny fluid change every 20k miles5. Rear differential / Transfer case fluid change every 20k preferably with high quality gear oil such as Amsoil SVG 75W90 etc6. Power steering fluid flush every couple years 7. Good suspension checkup and fixes on time.8. Fix the appearance as this play a bigger role than you think.. car washes et al.Babying a car will make you think twice in terms of giving it away for a pittance on a trade.. "
"akangl","July 2007"," I do religious oil changes, usually use Amsoil, but for the Durango we dumped in Mobil 1, was too lazy to go to the amsoil warehouse, we have an amsoil dealership. I'm very good about keeping required services done on my vehicles. I keep the exterior and interior in very good condition. I buy husky liners and take the floor mats out within a week of buying a vehicle, or in the Durango's case just put the liners in since the floor mats were missing. The Titan looked very good considering it had 56k on it, the interior was flawless, exterior had some extra wear, but hey it had been across the usa and canada twice. If I hit something or get hit I always get it fixed promptly because dents drive me crazy.Its not that I don't take care of the, I have no doubt I could run a car to 100k+ miles, I just get bored with them. Well, I wasn't bored with the Titan but that was a whole 'nother situation.My temptation is to buy an Armada or another Titan, I believe I could keep one of those to 100k, maybe past that.

And they seem to have better resale than some other bmw's--unlike my E39 5 series, which has plummeted in value  (So I should have just bought an X5 at the time, which is what I really wanted).

Last 2 times I went to the Honda store, they were ranting about how I could buy a Pilot for not that much more than a CR-V....Pilots are heavily discounted I think.PS-I noticed steine13's recomendation for a Forester.

So we did and OMG OMG OMG I was in love. Its perfect, its everything I want, the driving position was outstanding, it drove like a sports car, the kids loved the room inside. Best of all it didn't make me carsick!Now I'm on a mission to unload the Durango, going to sell it on my own to get as much as I can out of it. Hopefully very soon I will own an Acadia.

Now, the service indicator says it's 4600 miles until my next service. I've looked at the manual and the next service isn't supposed to be until 15k, so it looks like they messed something up when they reset it. "
"tifighter","July 2007"," Let's face it; if there was a sensible choice here(like buying a new car is ever sensible), the Pilot is it. Check out the prices paid forum; people are regularly seeing $6-7K off MSRP right now, but you still get that ironclad resale value.

"akangl","July 2007"," I would have already gotten a headliner from the junkyard when my little brother worked there, BUT, do you know how hard it is to find one for a Durango?? They looked nationwide, NONE! They had no Durangos or Dakotas in the yard, said they can't get the away from the rebuilders at the auctions.Next, I came PAINFULLY close to pulling a trigger today, thank goodness the sales manager saved me. After I had already liked the truck and everything he informed me it was a lemon law buyback so only had the powertrain warranty on it. Didn't surprise me since on the test drive the 4WD service light came on and after returning to the dealership it was blowing coolant all over the place out the radiator cap. Truck was an 05 Armada LE with 19k on it (yes, I'm a glutton for punishment). Price was wholesale, $6k back of retail.......guess I found out why, lol. :lemon: We are going to look at the Pilot on Friday, most likely that's going to be the one we pick. Unfortunatly they don't have the color I want so will have to wait until one comes in.Ran the Durango by the local park & sell, friend of mine there said no problem selling it for $10k. He said its got a lot going for it in that price range. However I have to replace the broken foglight (sitting here in a box) and fix the tear in the driver's side seat ($80). Other than that he liked it. He also said stay away from the Acadia, its going to drop like a rock, Armadas are fine on the used side, but the Pilot was the BEST choice hands down.Its a good thing I'm not into impulse buying anymore, lol. I'm trying to make an informed decision here. I did have the thoughts of just telling you guys to pick out my next car, but then visions of a pink Yugo changed my mind!  "
"guss","July 2007"," stopped by the local Pontiac store last night just to look at a 2005 vibe they had on the lot. I also sat in the G6 sedan they had in the showroom and walked the lot.Why does GM have to make their option packages so difficult. If I did the G6 I would want a 4 cylinder with the nicer wheel package. That can not be done , you have to get the sport package with the V-6. The interior was nice though with plenty of headroom. Tilt and telescoping steering wheel is the best invention since cup holders especially for taller people that put the seat all the way back.The salesman used to work at a Honda store, and I told him I was all so looking at Civics. He was also taller and he has a Civic and liked it alot,so that may hurt him.I have to set up some appointments and drive some now. "
"lilengineerboy","July 2007"," Why does GM have to make their option packages so difficult. If I did the G6 I would want a 4 cylinder with the nicer wheel package.TireRack.comDiscountTire.comTypically they are cheaper than OEM alloy wheel packages and you get to pick the tires so you can get ones that don't suck like the OEM ones typically do. Sometimes the dealer will give you a ""take-off"" price for the stockers (or you could eBay the hubcaps, which the dealer charges $50-70/ea, and maybe craigslist the stock tires/wheels). "
"guss","July 2007"," Yea, I thought about that but I am kinda conservative and like to stick to the factory options. I assume the manufacturer had a team of engineers working on the best suspension/tire package , who am I to go and change all of their hard work.Besides, when you are an accountant and show too much bling, people start to get nervous. :P It's bad enough that I change cars every year and half or so.

"lilengineerboy","July 2007"," I assume the manufacturer had a team of engineers working on the best suspension/tire package , who am I to go and change all of their hard work.They did, and then the marketing and accounting groups changed it anyway. :P Okay I kid. But what the engineering team specifies is the offset of the wheel (how much it sticks out towards the outside of the car and towards the inside), the wheel width (it will be stamped on the rim and in the owner's manual), and the diameter of the wheel. The marketing group has much more to do with the styling, and no self-respecting engineer would ever promote a cheesy hubcap on a steel wheel.Tires are a commodity cost item on cars in this price range, or they are picked for long life at the expense of vehicle handling and inclement weather abilities.When you put your vehicle information into those websites, it will help you pick wheels that have the same characteristics as the stock ones (unless you go to a plus 1 or plus 2 fitment - which is upgrading to a larger diameter wheel). If you wanted, you could just get wheels and have the stock tires mounted to them, or select higher performance tires and have the package shipped with the tires already mounted on the wheels and its just a matter of bolting them on the vehicle.

'Course I could do that, but I haven't had a 318Ti on my ""list"" really, altho.....At the Right Price, for a super nice low-mileage affordable bmw....??? Think about it: road trip back from NC in a nice bmw, Blue Mt Pkwy, NC BBQ.....where's it advertised? "
"akangl","July 2007"," I gotta know, I gotta know: what was the actual price? And it's the EX-L with leather & S/R? It looks nice! MSRP was $33,6something, got it for 29,500 OTD, not a record, might have been able to do better, but it was a pleasant experience so I was happy with the deal. It is an EX-L and has a sunroof.They stepped into the Durango, I think against the GM's better ideas. He drove it twice, really didn't want it, I was actually surprised with what he gave for it. This dealership is the type to turn down trades, he said the ONLY reason he was taking it was that it had a recent brake job and some other recent repairs that are known trouble spots, plus the low miles.I do have to say that I should have bought a Honda YEARS ago. WOW, just returned from driving 400 miles today, what a pleasant car to drive, I wasn't tired at all when I got home, actually thought about driving further, lol. Very refined, quiet, just impressive. Has 507 miles on it, had 4 miles when I got it yesterday, lol.First tank returned 21.7 mpg hwy through the mountains. "
"mark156","July 2007"," MSRP was $33,6something, got it for 29,500 OTD, Hmmm... that's almost exactly what I paid for the 2007 Honda CR-V... List was $29,049 and I paid $29,049 PLUS tax. The little CR-V's are so hot that there is no discount. As you know, I needed it for a tow vehicle and the weight of 3,400 lbs, style, amenities and tow ability is what sold me.Akangl, your impression of the Pilot is the same way I felt when driving the CR-V for the first time. I have never owned a Honda or even a Toyota before (owned a few Nissans) and I was also surprised at how pleasant they are to drive.BR is going to kill me. But, I'm on the California coast to get out of the heat of the desert and decided to take the Honda rather than the Land Rover... . The Honda gets twice the gas mileage. Prices for regular unleaded is running about $3.10 a gallon right now. Premium for the Land Rover would be $3.35 a gallon. A few months ago, I paid $3.95 for premium in the LR3.Anyway, I am so glad that you like your new Pilot. I have this crazy feeling that you will really keep it for 4 yrs... :surprise: ...nah, what am I thinking! :P Mark156 "

If it's fwd, then you paid about $500 over. And those prices didn't include D&D, or any other add-ons, so either you got a great deal, OR you got a reeeallly great deal.There are a few things that Hondas are lacking that bug me, like the lack of a compass and trip computers on anything other than Touring models, but those are not major issues.The only problem we've had with our Hondas is that we couldn't keep them ding and dent free. Listen to this run down.93 Accord - almost new, a kid at the school where my wife was teaching bodyslammed another kid on the hood. Then it was in three hit and run incidents within one year.03 Civic - guy pulling a trailer pulled out in front of me. Smashed the front corner of the car.07 Odyssey - ran over piece of metal in the road and scored the panel below the rear passenger door.07 Civic - my son had been playing with a hand-truck/dolley we have and left it behind the car.

They were pretty straight up, no games which I respect. We dealt with the GM when it came to numbers. He was honest, he said he'd discount the Pilot all the way down to invoice, then he ended up going another $500 under that. He had some factory money, so he didn't mind doing that and taking the Durango. I tried to get him to give up more, but he said he needed some cushion since he didn't know what he was going to do with the Durango. Our salesguy said he has never seen the GM give up so much so fast, lol. He also said he was surprised he took the Durango, usually he turns down the high mileage SUVs.I felt like it was a fair deal, they only had 2 EX-L Pilots and no more coming in until the 08's. The thing that I loved was how great we were treated, I mean they were really awesome. We've been in there 4 or 5 times recently looking, never were we treated badly. Our salesguy was top notch. He called me the next day to follow up and make sure everything was ok. Best buying experience EVER! I can see why they sold 170 cars last month! "

How is the back (3rd row) seat in the Pilot?

I'm so jealous. :mad: Here in Mississippi we get the double whammy - sales tax, plus a very expensive tag.

People drive Rolls/Mercedes/Bentley's/Jaguar's/BMW's/Land Rover's/Ferrari's/Lamborghini's/Porsche's, (a Cadillac is too low to drive :P ) etc., etc. that have a high selling price.

With some of the cars on your list, though, I think you have California mixed up with that place they show on TV.People also keep cars longer since there is no rust issue (the salt water is a little rough, but if the car has reasonably good paint its fine).

"corvette","July 2007"," ...that is just WAY too much for a cute-ute, IMHO...That was one of the reasons I passed on the CR-V. It's a really good car, but not something you pay list price for, high demand notwithstanding. I'm not complaining about price inflation (although I remember ten years ago when a fully loaded K1500 Suburban with leather was around $36,000--now it costs twice as much and has a Cadillac or Hummer badge on it). My gripe is that the CR-V is essentially the modern-day Civic wagon, with an Accord four-banger in it. (A four-cyl. Accord with NAV lists for around $25k if memory serves.) It should either cost the same as a similarly-equipped Accord or have as much power as a similarly-priced Accord. "
"mark156","July 2007"," qbrozen.. yep, it was $29,049. I was rather limited on my choices as this vehicle was to be used as a tow vehicle for the motorhome. Honda allows 'four-wheels-on-the-ground' towing if you perform the transmission towing sequence (Park, reverse, neutral, drive, 2, 1 then back up to 2, drive, then stop in neutral), then turn the key to accessory 1. The max speed is 65 mph and the engine must be started after 8 hrs of towing. Also, fuse #34 should be removed so that the radio will not run down the battery. I had a switch installed on the dash that will me disconnect' the fuse without crawling under the dash.There are really not that many choices unless you want to do expensive modifications.My choices were down to two, the Honda CR-V or the Jeep Liberty. The Jeep weighed more (3,700 lbs), had the tire on the back and got worse gas mileage (also changing style for 2008).The Honda weighs 3,400 lbs, 22/28 mpgs, peppy four cylinder engine, seat five comfortably and an amazing amount of storage room in the rear area.You need to check out the new CR-V if you haven't seen one. For $29,049, mine has:AWD, Navigation, 6 cd changer, leather seats, sunroof and dark tinted windows in the back. I had fog lights and front mud-guards added which is included in the price.To put the base plate on and the apparatus for the air brakes from the coach and the tow bar was $2,700. When I apply the brakes on the coach, the Honda brakes will apply at the same exact pressure. I didn't want my tow car to 'push' in a panic stop. Also, it's the law that the any tow vehicle over 1,500 lbs has to have it's own braking system.Mark156  "

"lilengineerboy","July 2007"," Nitrogen has bigger molecules than air, so it doesn't ""breathe out"" as fast as regular air (which is why you are supposed to check your tire pressures often). It is also more stable over temperature, so in climates like Michigan they don't loose quite as much over winter, and can help dissapate heat better over the summer. It also can help prevent rust on wheels. I think room air is 30% O2 and 60 or 70% N, so even regular air is mostly nitrogen.This guy rambles about it:Straight Dope "

The Outlooks that I've seen have been optioned up to the low to mid 30's, so I'm not sure there is as much overlap as you think.Plus, the VUE only has 2 rows of seats, so I can't imagine someone cross-shopping the two.dad23, I'm not sure that I'm ""searching"" at the moment. Heck, I'm not even sure I'm in the market, to be honest. I am just reviewing my options at the moment.

I really thought they were going to get another Camry, but when he found out he could get a V6 Sonata for less money than the 4-cyl Camry, he jumped at it.I think he paid somewhere around $16-17K for the Sonata before TTL.It now has 15K miles on it in 4 years.

"guss","July 2007"," Michael, I thought the 3 series starts at about $33k. I would think the base price would be closer to $25k or it would start taking sales away from it's bigger brother.I have never shopped for a new BMW, but to the move much off MSRP at the end of the model year ? "
"michaellno","July 2007"," I've been reviewing the posts on the 1-series board here at Edmunds. Lots of speculation currently, but the general consensus is a starting price of $25-28K for the 128i, and $30-33K for the 135i.Guess we'll have to wait and see. The one thing about the 1-series is that it will only be available as a coupe initially, with a convertible to come later.No sedan or 3/5 door hatches for the US. "
"guss","July 2007"," Funny you should mention coupe. I have been checking out the Civic coupe . The lines are just so much better than the 4 door.  But with 3 kids , I dunno if will be practical. My kids are smaller so space is not too much of an issue. It's more about stuffing them back there.

"fezo","July 2007"," Yeah, the new Ody. I will say that the new Ody came within a month after the Camry so I had a moment there. They just keep us around here for entertainment value.The price of the engine very nearly approximates the original price of the car.... It was a $6K car now getting a $5K engine. Assuming it doesn't blow a tranny (I would have the luck to have the first Toyota to blow both...) the engine should be worth it.

She wanted to pay the loan herself and all that. Being such a nice dad I got something where the payments would be easier. Now of course the entire picture has changed and I'm making the payments anyway. Heck, I could have gotten a decent two or three year old domestic for that.....Oh, well. She's happy and it should hold up.Jolie - great to hear about the Pilot. Honda will do that kind of thing to a lot of people. My buddy with the MDX was like that.

My wife saw a commercial for the new Altima coupe and thought it was nice(and she never comments on cars). So I stopped by the Nissan dealer too. They had one on the lot in a bad shade of red.

Also, you can pick individual options, instead of getting the whole ""packages"". Last time I picked out options, I think I was up to around $24,500 (w/o going totally crazy).I wonder if buying instead of leasing a Mini might not make more sense, given their reputed resale value. And way more flexible--even if you only kept it a year, you might not lose too much(?). Also, I'd rather not be locked in for 3 years with a car so totally in the ""toy"" category.Didn't British Rover own a Mini & sell it? "
"british_rover","July 2007"," Yup and it is way better to buy one then sell it on your own later.I paid 24,500 OTD for my MINI in July of 2004. I sold it for 21,xxx two years and 30,000 miles later.I think my pay off was 17,xxx or so at the time so I had a ton of equity in it. "
"qbrozen","July 2007"," the resale on those is just shocking to me. I am just amazed that there are so many people who would not rather pay a few grand more for a zero mile new one. To me, I gotta save AT LEAST $5k to even consider used over new. "
"nippononly","July 2007"," Me too, and I am absolutely STUNNED at the outrageous resale prices of Minis. But not so stunned I couldn't buy one and take advantage of the fact...The way I see it, leasing with nothing down on the base model would run about $310/mo, and if that's for an automatic, I wonder if they couldn't do at least the same rate or a few bucks cheaper on a stick? Buying it with nothing down (to provide an appropriate comparison) would be another $75/month probably (on a 5-year loan). I have optioned up Minis on the website, and really except for the paint charge, I wouldn't put many options on. It looks like you have to order the ""sport steering wheel"" to get cruise? So that and the paint would be it for me, with maybe a couple hundred dollars worth of Union Jack stickers and other frippery thrown in for fun...So what's the skinny? Is anyone out there buying Minis below sticker? Or is this car just too hot for that? "

Destination & Handling.Leaving off leather is my concession to fiscal sanity. I go nuts with option lists, why I usually buy used (& live with the car as is). But I hate driving around in a car ticked off because I didn't get the Xenons or premium stereo or whatever, but I ""saved"" $2-3K.Today I saw this beautiful blue new 5 series pulling into the parking lot I was in, and a fairly gorgeous young blonde woman driver get out (of course).

"british_rover","July 2007"," Depending on the book you consult these are the options that add value to a MINI on the used side.XenonsLeatherSunroofNavigationand sometimes upgraded H/K systemNotice that it is not the sport package, which includes xenons, that adds value or the premium package, that includes a sunroof, but the individual option.When I ordered my MINI I got the premium package in its entirety because I wanted ACC, the multi-function steering wheel and the trip computer. I got the cold weather package because heated seats help my back even though I lived in the south at the time. I did not buy the entire sport package though because it included the 52 lbs each 17 inch run flat wheels/tires. I got xenons and fog lights as individual options instead of buying the whole package. I couldn't stand having a 2,600 lbs car with over 200 lbs of wheels and tires on it. I didn't get leather because I thought it was a ripoff to pay 1,300 dollars for about two square yards of leather in the MINI. I specifically tried out a leatherette car and then a real leather car in a blind [non-permissible content removed] test to see if I could tell the difference. I had my adviser bring up a car with leatherette and a car with real leather without telling me which was which and I couldn't tell the difference between the two cars. "
"steine13","July 2007"," ... keep in mind that it's a supply/demand thing.

"andre1969","July 2007"," I swore that I'd try to hold off on buying anymore cars for as long as possible, but now my Intrepid's starting to irritate me. Well, that plus the fact that there's a local used car lot that has two cars that caught my interest.My '00 Intrepid has about 134,000 miles on it, and I just noticed yesterday that the a/c isn't really blowing so cold anymore. It needs new tie rod bushings, too. While the tie rods are no biggie to fix, and the a/c could just need a recharge, it's starting to make me think that it's time to cut this one loose before some major repairs start rearing their ugly heads.Anyway, here's what I found at the car lot:1) 2006 Dodge Charger police car, with only 1928 miles on it. I think it only has the 3.5 V-6 (they have it listed as a 3.7). They're asking something like $23K for it. It's a midnight blue color. I only saw it today as I was driving past, and then happened to look it up online.2) 2004 Dodge Intrepid police car, 53,000 miles, ~$10K. Also midnight blue. Supposedly back then, the Intrepid copcar would run rings around the Impala copcar and even take on the Crown Vic in top speed, but had a little issue with brakes that burst into flames during a copcar test, and as a result the Trep never was that popular.I had an ex police car once, an '89 Gran Fury that performed well and handled great, but got lousy mileage around town, tended to eat starters, and wasn't the most reliable thing in the world. So I dunno if I'm up for that experience again. Copcars tend to get run hard, and often the tales of excellent maintenance they receive are more myth than reality.I kinda wonder about the '06 Charger with only 1928 miles on it, though. Makes me wonder what's wrong with it! Although I hear that the Charger really hasn't been too hot as a police car, so maybe they just couldn't find a buyer, or it got rejected. And it probably doesn't have enough bling for the civilian used market.Plus, I'm guessing that the days of a police car performing much better than its civilian counterpart are pretty much history. My old Gran Fury had 35 more hp (175 versus 140) and a quicker rear end (2.94:1 versus 2.26) than the civilian models, but I don't think there's much difference these days, except for maybe better brakes, tires, and heavy-duty stuff like tranny and oil coolers. "
"geffen","July 2007"," I would go with the Dodge Charger especially with only 1928 miles thats practically new. I would never buy another Dodge Intrepid I had a 2004 with nothing but issues I was in the dealer service dept at least once a month with the engine light on or other wheel bearing problems. "
"bumpy","July 2007"," I think it only has the 3.5 V-6 (they have it listed as a 3.7)Could be the 2.7L V6, which might explain why the cops dumped it so soon.  "

"guss","July 2007"," Would they even put something as small as the 2.7L in a police car ? I thought the Charger with the V-8 would be a hit with most Police departments, but I don't see many around here. I guess the cops got used to driving Explorers and Expeditions like everyone else. "
"andre1969","July 2007"," I thought the Charger with the V-8 would be a hit with most Police departments, but I don't see many around here. I guess the cops got used to driving Explorers and Expeditions like everyone else.Yeah, you'd think the Hemi Charger would be a hit, but I imagine that it's somewhat expensive compared to the Crown Vic. It's probably a lot more expensive to repair, as well. The Crown Vic is a relatively simple, durable, sturdy machine that can take a lot of pounding. It can push disabled cars out of the way, hop curbs, etc fairly well, and has a pretty high load capacity. One of my friends has an '04 Crown Vic, and the little GVWR sticker on the door says 5600 pounds. I'd guess the car weighs around 4100-4200? Well, a Hemi Charger/300C weighs almost that, but only has a GVWR of around 4800-4900 pounds. It's built to go fast and handle well, but really can't take that much of a beating, most likely.I remember seeing a police test of a Magnum with the 3.5, and it was considerably slower than the Intrepid with the 3.5. I'm guessing the heavier body, heavier RWD setup, etc, hurt it somewhat.With police cars, I think they make (or used to make) them in three different classes: Patrol class, Pursuit class, and Interceptor class. Interceptors are usually the high performance stuff like Camaros and Mustangs, but also lesser stuff, like the high-output sedan versions. My '89 Gran Fury, with its 318-4bbl, for example, was considered an Interceptor. However, there was also a police version of the 318-2bbl Gran Fury. Basically, they took the civilian model and gave it upgrades such as the windage tray, transmission/oil coolers, bigger brakes, etc, but no performance mods, so it still had the tame engine and rear-end. That was what they called the Pursuit class.Then, there's the Patrol class, which is meant for patroling neighborhoods, going to court, donut runs, serving summonses, etc. No real need for it to perform, as it's designed for light duty, and if they need to go catch a speeder, for example, they just call in for an interceptor or pursuit, I guess. Back in the day they used to make Mopar police cars with slant six engines for this purpose. Also, K-cars and Citations were occasionally pressed into service.I'd hope that they wouldn't be dumb enough to put a 2.7 into a Charger copcar, but if it was just a patrol class vehicle, I guess it's a possibility. Personally, I'd like to see Chrysler just drop this engine entirely and replace it with a lower-output 3.5, or a de-stroked/de-bored version, like the 3.2 they used from 1998-01. The 2.7 is just too expensive to manufacture, VERY expensive to replace when it breaks, and the engine is really too peaky, power wise, to work in a heavier car like a Charger. They had to re-cam the thing for use in the heavier cars, which knocked peak hp down from 200@~6000 to 190@6400, while torque stayed the same at 190 ft-lb. It's supposed to be a broader curve though, and the peak comes on at 4000 rpm, rather than ~4900.Still, putting a 2.7 under the hood of a 3800 pound Charger makes about as much sense as putting an 85 hp slant six under the hood of a full-sized 1980 Mopar. And yes, they did that, too!  I wonder if the 2.7 is so overmatched that real world (rather then EPA estimate) fuel economy is better with the bigger engine? That used to be the case with some of the 1979-83 Mopars, where the 318 would actually get better economy than the slant six. "
"andre1969","July 2007"," if anyone wants to check 'em out, here's the link for the Charger, and here's the link for the Intrepid. "
"qbrozen","July 2007"," looks great with those wheels! I could be wrong, but I don't believe the 2.7 comes with traction control, so that could be your answer.(?)maybe they dumped it because they wanted the V8?OR, maybe it was a tester. You know, the one they got to see if it would suit their needs and then they would order more. It didn't fly, so bye bye. "
"guss","July 2007"," I can see why you like the police packages. The Charger is nasty looking. Is the black a repaint of the traditional black and white ?You are kinda of a hoarder(no offence I hope), will you end up having to fix your Intrepid anyway if you buy one of these. I can see not trading it in if you will only get small money for it. "
"andre1969","July 2007","  The Charger is nasty looking. Is the black a repaint of the traditional black and white ? I'm not sure where these dark blue police cars are coming from, but I remember back in the day, this particular lot used to get a run of Crown Vic copcars (the older ""flying brick"" style) that were painted in that same scheme. So I'd imagine that some federal agency is ordering them. I'm hoping they're factory-painted, or at least professionally done up somewhere, and not just a re-spray. The county copcars around here are just the generic white, although in the next county over, they're a mix of dark blue and light blue. And I think Maryland state police cars are a combination of black and dark green. Once upon a time they used to be tan.If I did buy one of these cars, I'd probably just trade my Intrepid to be done with it. I do tend to hoard things, but I'm also a little bit leery about keeping newer cars too far past their expiration date. The days of $1000 engines, $650 transmissions, and $1.98 ballast resistors are long gone when it comes to newer cars! And even if I don't get much in trade for it, it'll still be one less thing to insure, maintain, repair, pay registration on, etc. "
"michaellno","July 2007"," Yeah, but do you want to start over with car payments again?Or, do you feel that is an acceptable trade-off to have a reliable car in your fleet? "
"andre1969","July 2007"," Yeah, but do you want to start over with car payments again? Ooh, yuck...I forgot about car payments!  Plus, I had been thinking about getting something a bit more economical and smaller next time around, like a Civic or 4-cyl Altima. Getting an ex-police car is kind of going in the opposite direction! I'd really like to hold off on car payments for as long as possible, and I figure as long as repairs on the Intrepid end up running significantly less than a monthly payment, I'll try to keep it running. I've put about $1300 into it so far this year, which comes out to around $185-190 per month. When I was still paying it off, it was $347.66 per month.I didn't have to put hardly any money into it in 2006. Just oil changes, a transmission service, a junkyard wheel/tire/hubcap from when one got stolen off the car, and a new tire when another one got popped from hopping a curb. Maybe that's what made it ultimately need a new bearing hub? In 2005 I had to have new rear brake pads put on, put in a new battery myself (a real pain, next time I might just pay to have it done), and fix an oil pan leak (drain hole stripped).I guess I've put maybe $2000 into the car, plus oil changes/filters/etc, since it was paid off in November 2004, and that only comes out to about $65 per month. I could probably keep the thing running indefinitely for less than what a monthly car payment on an equivalent new car would be, but at some point in time I'll ultimately get tired of it.Optimally, I'd like to hold off until next summer before replacing it.

"nippononly","July 2007"," Of course, one major engine or transmission repair can cost as much as a whole year of payments. On an older car, you could get two of those in 2 years, and adding in the cost of other smaller repairs, the logic of keeping it vs getting the new car under warranty with a 3- or 4-year loan comes into question. Not intending to contradict you here, just saying ""always"" might be going a bit too far. Most of the time it does pay to keep your old car going, just on the pure numbers. But then there's the other considerations (newer car, nicer car, upsizing, downsizing, more safety, more/less features, etc), including my personal nemesis, CCBS! :-P "

On an older car, you could get two of those in 2 years, and adding in the cost of other smaller repairs, the logic of keeping it vs getting the new car under warranty with a 3- or 4-year loan comes into question.That was one of the good things about my '89 Gran Fury copcar. I remember asking the guy I bought it from about replacement costs. I bought it from a dealership that specializes in refurbishing old police cars. He said that if the engine blew, he could put in another used one for about $1,000. If the tranny went, he could throw in a used one for around $300 or so. The downside though, is that this place was about 60 miles from where I live, so it would've been annoying to get it towed out there.I never did have any problems with the engine or tranny, specifically, on that car. It had a voracious appetite for starters, though. The fuel pump also went out on it, and so did the distributor. Also needed a new radiator and one freeze plug, and two power window motors, and I'm sure some other odds and ends I'm forgetting. I finally gave up on it when the water pump started to go. At that point it had about 118,000 miles on it. If I had never bought the Intrepid, I would have kept that Gran Fury longer, and put the money into it, but I was just getting tired of it. I also discovered that a lot of its parts would swap onto my '79 5th Avenue, so I'll admit I did a bit of cannibalizing, once the water pump went out.In contrast, I think with my Intrepid, if the 2.7 blows it's about $6K, and if the tranny goes it's around $2000-2500. I've heard it's actually cheaper to swap a 3.2/3.5 into an Intrepid if the 2.7 blows, but if my engine goes, I'm still not sinking that kind of money into it. Luckily, the engine does still seem strong, although it does blow just a little bit of gray smoke on startup. "

And $200 of that was because I spaced on getting the 15K service until a month after the free maintenence period ran out (Doh!). I'm not sure I'd have the guts to own an out-of-warranty 7-series. Too bad, 'cuz they're such great cars (at least pre-Bangle), but known for needing lots of really expensive repairs & maintenence. And maintaining a 12 cyl. model can get even more insane. But, maybe no more so than a similar era S-Class or the Audi A8.Ditto for the 8-Series I've heard.I dunno about avoiding AWD on bmw's. There are people still driving E30 3 series AWD models from 16-20 years ago, but that was a totally different AWD system I believe than recent models. Obviously tho AWD will probably be more expensive to repair than 2WD..... "

"andre1969","August 2007"," hat is a big car--my grandfather has one and it barely fits in his garage. The sheetrock in front of it has the scars to prove it! Although, with your fleet, I guess you're used to a bigger car...Yeah, compared to most of the cars I've had, that Park Ave might not seem that big. I guess it's what? About 208"" long? That's about what my '76 LeMans is. Still, sometimes the shape of a car, or its blind spots, etc, can be more of a determinant in maneuverability than actual dimensions. For instance, when I took my LeMans to the GM Nationals in June, I had to parallel park in front of the place I was staying. I could not park that thing to save my life! I can't see the back of the car because of the way it slopes, and I was always further away from the curb than I thought it was. I think part of it may be the beltine, though. In most modern cars, the beltline gradually slopes upward, and even in something like my '79 New Yorker, it's level. But on the LeMans, it actually drops down a bit towards the back of the door. So maybe that was throwing off my perception a bit?My '79 New Yorker has about 13 inches on my LeMans, but I find it to be a cinch to park. It's more squared-off though, and I can see its decklid through the rear window, so that helps me to judge.My Intrepid is a nightmare when it comes to visiblity. Huge C-pillar (not that obvious frome the exterior styling, but from the inside looking out it rivals any 70's car I've ever had), high rear window that obscures the decklid, and a sloping hood that I can barely see. But the edges of the car are rounded off enough that it's not too hard to squeeze its 203 inches into some pretty tight spots. Plus, it also has a fairly low beltline. "

The dealer we are working with is part of a chain that owns 5 Saturn dealers in Colorado, so I suspect a dealer trade for them may be easier than most.The way I figure it is that my car is almost paid off and doesn't make sense to start over, whereas with the wife's car, we still have quite a few payments left, so starting over may not be so bad.

I guess I just trust the '85 more.Oh, and I put about 400 miles on the Intrepid this past weekend. Nothing scary to report, the air conditioning even (mostly) worked, and it averaged around 28-29 mpg. So hopefully I can hold off on renewing my CCB membership for a bit longer. "
"fezo","August 2007"," I don't like the sound of that combination - overheating and catalytic converter. My daughter's Camry finally got back from the shop and we have the horrid details - it overheated on the Garden State Parkway which caused an oil line to blow which seized the engine and blew out the cat. The whole chain of events started because of a clog in the radiator.Swell. "
"colloquor","August 2007"," Why does anyone trade in cars in the first place? If you want to get low-balled, and also not be able to get as much off the top end of the new car, I guess trading is OK - if you like to throw away money!You're much, much better off spending a weekend detailing your car, and selling it privately. Yes, it will take a few hours of your life, but you will be thousands of dollars ahead. "
"nippononly","August 2007"," All there are in the private market are low-ballers and more low-ballers. If I am going to get low-balled, I might as well go to the dealer and trade in - at least there the buyer expects it to be a negotiation! And at the dealer it's quick, and I don't have to stay in town on weekends for three months straight hoping that THIS is the weekend when the buyer finally comes around! Or cancelling plans only to have the prospective buyer not show at the appointed hour. "
"guss","August 2007"," Also, in my state you get a sales tax credit for the amount of your trade. So if I have a $10k trade I get $600 to start. Best I could hope for if I sold it myself would be $1500 more the trade in.Is the $900 significant money ? Yes, but as Nippon said you are opening yourself up to a bunch of problems. Like will people show up, will they have valid drivers licenses to drive my car, will their cashiers check be real, and will they come back after the sale and sue me because something broke on the car. "
"qbrozen","August 2007"," I'm even more skeptical than guss. I say you can typically expect $1k more selling it yourself than trading. So on a $15k car, with my state's 7% tax rate, I actually get MORE by trading it in. "
"british_rover","August 2007"," Yeah there are only a few cars that are worth selling private party.Older low mileage Japanese sedans and coupes for the most part are better off going the private party route. "
"qbrozen","August 2007"," yup. My rule of thumb is pretty much anything $8k or less AND less than 10 years old. OR more than 10 years old, regardless of miles or value.If its a young car worth more than $8k, I would just trade it in. .... well, unless its something special and hard to come by. "
"stickguy","August 2007"," I traded in my tC last year when I got the Accord. Got 14K for it (real value, I already had ground the Accord to the bone, I think!).I am in NJ also, so with the tax credit, I would have had to net more than 15K private sale to even start being ahead. And ads in the paper run $50 a week, etc.Then, I would have had young folks with no money showing up, have to deal with people getting financing, etc.All this for a 1.5 YO car that you could buy brand new for less than 17K at the time. So, exactly how much more than 15K could I have epxpected?If trade in value was say 12K, I would have kept it and sold privately (or just kept it). Now, if I am selling a 1999 Sentra or Protege with 65K on it, that baby is going private sale, since trade in will be lousy (maybe a couple of K), and it will be easy to get 1-2K more doing it myself, and the sales tax credit is pretty small. "
"stickguy","August 2007"," These teaser lease ads have got to stop. They are distracting me.Now Volvo is offering a 2 year sign and drive (zippo up front $) on an S80. I haven't driven one, but man, is it nice to sit in!This is right after BMW was taunting me with the lease deal on a 3 series. Almost went in for that one.Of course, it would be hard to justify getting rid of a paid off Accord to start renting something else. Maybe I can play the safety card for my son who is just getting his permit? That, and let him learn on someone elses car (the leaser)!Although that would mean learning on an AT instead of a manual, which might save me some gray hair!And give me an excuse to put the Accord cash back into a toy, so I have a stick to drive!

"metro123","August 2007"," I have been debating whether to sell or trade my car and I find this descussion very timely. I have an 01 Civic EX sedan, silver, 5 speed with 58K miles. Car is mint. Now knowing the stupid money people pay for used Hondas, do I sell privately? I might just put out an ad and see what happens. I'm not in a hurry to sell and the car is currently parked in my garage. I'm driving my Lex GS400 for now.I have sold two other cars privately before and both transactions went smoothly but those cars were $2500 and $4500 each. I guess the sooner I sell it the sooner I can start shopping. We'll see... "
"woodyww","August 2007"," When I finally sell my yr. 2000 bmw, I plan to (try to) sell it privately. Reason is, because it's a super-low mileage ""cream puff"", & a wagon, & I know no dealer will really pay up for the low miles, while OTOH, I'm hoping the low mileage wagon will have a lot of appeal when I advertise it. My Gut is telling me maybe I could get an extra 25-30% selling it privately, but only one way to find out of course. (Latest edmunds prices were $11,675 trade-in, $14,628 retail, inc. adding for the miles). I agree with nippononly about what a huge PITA it can be, altho I've found it varies a lot according to vehicle, & probably luck. It can be worth a try running an ad, & the offers you get can help you to judge your trade-in offer(s).When I sold my range rover, best private offer I got was $28K, as was the best dealer offer, where I traded it in & saved $1400 in sales tax. Fortunately the RR lookers didn't give me much grief, unlike some other cars I've sold.There was a sobering post by Mathias on the RWTIV board about selling his new-ish P/U, & all the grief potential ""buyers"" gave him. Made me think, if it's a hassle even for him......I guess I'm just saying, it totally depends on the car, mileage, condition, area, & maybe the position of the planets, but it can be at least worth running an ad or 2 to ""test the market"".....sometimes.....

"british_rover","August 2007"," Your BMW is a good candidate for a private sale even though it is a little above the normal price range for relatively easy private sales.The people looking at your car will probably have 15,000 or so in cash that they can scrounge up.

I still would have sold it myself if I had a garage space for it, but I didn't want to keep it outside. The only thing I would worry about are test pilots. I do not regret the decision. The place I traded it into had it less than a week, too. "

(I'd had a $1000 brake job done a few months before, & was not eager to have the new rotors warped).One of the Yuppie brake-Slamming idiots made an offer, then put me thru Hell, the day of the sale, all day long, in 90 degree heat, by conning me into taking it to his mechanic 30 miles away, & then trying to grind me down more after getting the voluminous report back. I knocked off another $100.I made about $2K more than the best $4400 dlr offer, so that's......$2K, & I made them pay in green cash, folding US currency. Oh yeah, & I pre-negotiated the buyer giving me a ride back the 30 miles to my bmw mechanic, where I picked up my vintage BMW, so then I not only still had a vintage BMW, but also $6500 in cash.

I expect the no shows, the tire kickers and the time wasters but I also know I have real gem of a car and so I know someone will pay $$$ for it. It should sell quick. Most of the Civics in my area are miled up commuters or get ragged out by the kids so finding a nice one is tough.

It's hard to tell how much the AC sucks (my E55 gets to go in for a warranty repair soon as the AC has did again), and you can't judge just how hard it will be to keep it looking pristine. "

When I checked the Kia's resale value and found that it was less than the 3 year-old Passat I previously drove, I started looking at Toyotas again. After a truly draining experience at a dealership about 45 miles from home, I ended up leasing an 07 Sienna. I really like it; it fits in my garage, it's lighter to drive, yada, and more yada... However, I dread telling my family, 'cause I know what they'll say.

"
"stickguy","August 2007"," well Woody, if you want to apply financial logic to the situation, I don't think I want to talk to you any more! I would have money left over, depending on what I could actually sell the Accord for. What is a 2005 4 door EX-L 5 speed with 15K on it worth? TOo bad there isn't a carsmack nearby..So, lets say 16K (gotta say something). The VOlvo is easy, about $500/month x 24 = $12KBMW is ~350 (tax inc) for 36, so that is (tking socks off here, give me a minute..) $12,600 + ~3,000 up front, so say $15,600.So, hypothetically, I could drive a new VOlvo for 2 years and have 4K left over for new wheels. THe BMW is even easier. Basically, I trade the Accord for the privelege of driving a BMW for 3 years, and than having no car and no money.I'm no savant, but I bet the Accord 3 years from now with less than 50K on the clock will be worth more than zero! And well more than 4K in 2 years.But I still wouldn't mind having a 3 series. After all, I deserve it!Oh, did I mention that college tuition starts in 2 years?Actually, if I did make a move, I might rather trade in the Odyssey. Not quite as comfortable that it will be a long lasting trouble free experience. Plus vans get squeaky and rattle trappy as they get older. "

I practically salivate every time I see one in a color I like.If you get the new 3, I'd say, see if there are any options you really want, like the SPP, or Xenons.

Meanwhile, the Subaru dealer has let me know he has an '07 Legacy wagon (5-sp) which he could let go for around $19K including the current rebate. It's not sporty like the SI or the WRX, but it is AWD and a decently peppy ride. I think my attention is wandering too much. :sick:I will write back the Honda dealer and say no thanks and please stop e-mailing me.

Come pick your car up at any time; we close at 6.(10 minutes later)Me: Honey, the Saturn dealer can't figure out what is wrong with your car. They can't promise the problem won't happen again.Mrs. Michaell: Huh.(At the dealer around 5:30)SSR: Here is your paperwork; no charge for the diagnosis.Mrs. Michaell: Do you want to see what they have on the lot?Me: Sure.Saturn Sales Manager: We have this nice Techno Gray XR AWD with everything you want on it. We just got it in today and haven't even had time to unwrap it. Three whole miles on it.Mrs. Michaell: Can we drive it?

We don't need no steenkin' negative equity.(after we come to an agreement on selling price and trade in value)Salesman: Congratulations on your new purchase. However, since the car wasn't prepped, you can't take it home with you today.Us: We understand.(in Finance Managers office)Saturn Finance Manager: Sign here, here, here, here and here.Us: Got it.We are now the proud owners of a 2008 Techno Gray VUE XR AWD. Convenience package, heated seats, trailering package (3500 lbs.), chrome skid plates (a little bling never hurt) and a 6 CD changer with 3 months of XM.Mrs. Michaell is happy, for she now has a car that she feels she can trust.

Saturn is definitely on it's way up.It's funny how a little bit of unreliability can push us over the edge. That feeling of being stranded somewhere is a powerful motivateor.Good luck with the new Vue! "
"michaellno","August 2007"," Thanks. Even though one of the biggest assets of the Saturn brand is no more (the polymer side panels), I think that Saturn, by becoming the ""Opel of America"" is on the right track.We were able to take a longer test drive last night than the first time. My impression is that the extra weight slows it down compared to our '04 ... the pounds per HP went from about 14.5 on the '04 to just under 17.However, there is way less noise overall .. could be the extra sound deadening, could be the construction, but it is so quiet in comparison. The transmission (6-speed auto with tap shift) changes gears very well, and the tap shift allows my wife more control of gear selection in the winter.Inside, the Playskool feel is minimized in the new car - it looks and feels so much more upscale. Not sure how much we'll use XM, as the AUX jack will see lots of use, given that everyone in our family has an iPod. Another feature the wife really likes is the remote start .. great all year long, so she can cool the car off in the summer and heat it up in the winter. Also comes with a heating system for the wiper fluid.Interior space for passengers is about the same, but there is less cargo space due to the new design.We pick it up this afternoon. As I mentioned before, it had just arrived off the truck yesterday and hadn't been prepped by the dealer at all. It goes to Ft. Collins and back this weekend, so the wife will give me an update on how it drives. I've told her she'll have to vary the speed to help break the engine in - she can't just set the cruise at 75 for the entire trip. "

Although I had a strong suspicion yesterday when I told the wife that they couldn't reproduce the problem, the '04 was on its way out the door.We talked, very briefly, about something other than a Saturn. She had made the comment about wanting a vehicle that we could service in our hometown - which meant Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Suzuki, Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick or Hummer. All but Suzuki I get supplier discounts for.We had seen a Jeep Patriot over the weekend and I commented to her about how it was the reincarnation of the original Cherokee .. she sorta liked it, but she really likes the whole approach Saturn has about customer service.A co-worker of hers has a new 4-door Wrangler, and the wife really liked that, but recognizes that it probably would have been too harsh and unrefined for her.

"stickguy","August 2007"," is the wildcard to my CCBA. She pretty much lets me do what I with my car (or more accurately, I just stopped asking her in advance!) She depends on my inherent cheapness to keep it in check.But, for her car, she is usually in the keep in indefinitely catagory (why do you need a new one, what the matter with the old one?). Especially now that we get her nicer stuff!However, that only goes until she doesn't trust it anymore. Getting stranded, especially if she is by herself, can be the kiss of death. She might give it a 2nd chance, but I know that if it stranded her twice, or started becoming problematic (with unplanned trips to the dealer), I would get instructions to go find a replacement.So Michael, what did you do to the '04 to get it to crap out? I might have to try the same thing! "

I never told her what I was trading for, so when I pulled up in the Mazda6 wagon and she was on the front porch with the neighbors her look was stunned.I think the big problem was that she hates wagons and hatchbacks for some reason.

"woodyww","August 2007"," michaell, good luck with the new VUE. What kind of warranty does it have?--just curious.I got some good advice here on garage doors a few months ago. Someone recommended ""Overhead Door Company""--it's a brand of door, with local installers, & I called them & got a verbal estimate of $650 to $750 for a single width door installed, etc.Haven't had it done yet because the asphalt shingle roof is also shot, so I'm starting to get estimates & do some research, which is slightly more fun than Root Canal. One guy with a yellow pages ad came out & said $800 to put new fiberglass shingles over the old, & scribbled out an estimate on a piece of paper. He ""forgot his roofing color samples"". I told him to do it on Friday, woke up today & my gut said to get more estimates, so I called & cancelled.Finally after a week of web surfing I found the ""CertainTeed"" (a very good brand of shingles & siding) site, where they have lists of qualified local installers with different ""ratings"", insurance, etc so I'm starting to call various contractors for estimates. Need to figure out whether to have the old shingles stripped--it adds about 50%.Hoping to get a quality door, & roofing job for $2K or less....(& then I'll still only have a 1 car garage with a crumbling concrete floor, but I can deal with that).Sorry for the long boring OT post (oh wait, that describes all my posts, duh.....). I HATE dealing with house repairs..... :sick: "
"stickguy","August 2007"," do what you want, but it is a much better idea to take the old ones off. It really is quick, although it is messy. I think much of the extra cost is to haul them away!You get a better quality job, less stress on the roof, lasts longer, all that good stuff.Plus, if there are any nasty surprises (say, rotted sheathing from water leaks), you are just adding another ton of weight on top of it, hiding the problem.That is, until the day the roof caves in and buries the BMW!I just had my whole house reroofed (decent size 2 story colonial), and they did the whole job in 1 day (a long day, and fairly large crew, but still they really motored).

"kyfdx","August 2007"," Ditto on removing the old shingles.... "
"andre1969","August 2007"," I'll echo that sentiment. Especially if it's an old garage, go ahead and tear the existing shingles off. God only knows what kind of rot there might be hiding underneath. Last November, I got up on the roof of my house to track down a water leak, and found a soft spot. Before I knew it, what I thought might be a spot of only a few inches square turned into about 4x5 feet worth of rot!That stuff will only spread, so while you're re-roofing, that's a good time to get a good idea of just how much repair your roof will need. Plus, hauling away the old shingles from a one-car garage shouldn't be *too* bad. If nothing else, just think about what a pain it'll be 20-25 years down the road when it needs another new roof, and you'll then have to be hauling away TWO one-car garage's worth of shingles! "

"michaellno","August 2007"," What kind of warranty does it have?--just curious.Base BTB is 3/36, and GM has been offering a 5/100K warranty on the drivetrain since last year. We extended the BTB to 6/75K. Dealer pays for all oil changes for the first 2 years or 24K miles (whoopee!).Picked it up yesterday afternoon. Delivery process was somewhat abbreviated, as this is our 5th Saturn (4th new one). Somehow, the dealer has misplaced one set of keys, so we've got a ""We Owe"" on that --- salesman swears he saw both sets at one time, but if they can't locate them, another key will have to be cut and a fob programmed. I really don't want to have to go back to the dealer for this. Wife thinks they should come to us. She and I talked about the survey. At this point, we aren't sure that we can give them all 5's; they have told us repeatedly that if there is anything that would prevent us from doing so, to let them know.I owe them the GM Supplier PIN number still.First impressions, pro:-> Tremendously quiet; hard to tell the engine is even running at idle-> Tight steering and suspension. For a car weighing over 2 tons, it holds the road very well. I love the hydraulic steering of the new VUE as compared to the electronic steering of the '04-> Even though the seat of the pants tells me that acceleration isn't quite as ""right now"" as the '04, it does gather steam quite well if you keep your foot plantedFirst impressions, con:-> This is probably a user issue, but we used the remote start feature yesterday, but the car wouldn't come out of park. Had to turn it off and restart it before we could go anywhere. Since I work in tech support, I suspect that ""RTFM"" is in order.-> I, like andre, wish that modern cars had longer bottom seat cushions. In my L300, the cushion goes all the way to my knee. In the VUE, that isn't the case. But, since I'll only drive it maybe 15-20% of the time, I can live with it.stickguy, a question .. how do you like XM? The VUE has it (with the 3 month trial period), but the wife has said that she'll probably not use it, as the VUE also has the AUX jack which she'll use for her iPod. I tried to explain to her that XM may expose her to songs that she might ultimately want to download, but it seems to be an uphill battle. I'll try to get some pictures taken this weekend and post them. "
"stickguy","August 2007"," sounds nice. i agree that short seat cushions are a chronic problem these days, and something i can't live with. One reason we picked the Odyssey over the Sienna was that the Honda had much longer cushions. I had seemingly no thigh support in the Toyota.Anyway, I love XM. Even better if you like baseball, especially an out of market team.I have had my Accord for almost 2 years, and I still have never programmed an FM button. i don't even know what the local stations are anymore. I also don't bring the ipod in my car, and we don't even use it much in the van when we travel now that it has XM too.Besides not having to fiddle with the ipod, XM is nice because you can try out lots of different genres, or switch to a slew of different talk stations. Unless she has a huge library on her ipod, the selection on XM is much better. You can't neccessarily pick the song you want, but you can pick the type of music.I have found a bunch of artists that I wasn't familiar with that i ended up buying their music for the home library.So, I would excourage her to use the XM exclusively at first to see how she likes it, since it is free. She will either get hooked, or just decide to go back to the ipod and let the subscription lapse. "
"stickguy","August 2007"," Oh, if it isn't convenient for you to go back, just ask them to fed ex it to you. Did it at least come with a valet key so you have a spare now? "
"british_rover","August 2007"," I think you have to go back for the key no matter what. Generally they keys have to be programed by a tech or they won't work with the car. They can only do that at the dealership.Look what is on autoblog this morning... Found that interesting. "
"michaellno","August 2007"," Thanks for the feedback.Is there some sort of machine that is needed to program the key? If not, why not have the tech come to us?No, there is no 'valet' key .. we only have the one key for the car at the moment, so if the wife loses it or locks it in the car ... well, we do have OnStar for the latter.On XM radio .. I tried to point out those arguments to her (wider variety of music, may find an artist we would like to own), but, to this point, no luck. She is not into sports or talk radio. She has an iPod nano, which is almost full with close to 1000 songs on it. Most of the stuff she has been getting lately has been from our 19 year old daughter.When I drive it on the weekends, I'll see what kind of luck I have in listening to XM. I reviewed the program guide last night and there are a bunch of stations that I think we would be happy to listen to. Generally, our tastes in music are a bit different (I like 80's and metal, while she is more into Sheryl Crow and the like).One other note: when we were signing the paperwork with the finance guy on Monday, he told us we were eligible for a rebate on both the GAP insurance and the extended warranty on the '04 VUE. We gave him the paperwork, and he'll take care of the rest. I don't know if it's a straight pro-rated refund, but I'm hoping that the money coming back to us will cover the cost of the registration, which I'm estimating will be over $600.Tonight, we have to move everything from the trunk of my L300 to the VUE and set up OnStar.

I know it's slow), but from a passenger standpoint, it is the worst car that I've seen in the last ten years..In the front, the console intrudes into the passenger compartment. In the rear, the outboard seats are stuck right up against the windows, so you have headroom issues. Hatch storage and access? I swear.. you can haul a good size Yorkshire Terrier back there, with room to spare.Considering the strange seating position in the CR-V, I could see someone seeing the Caliber as an improvement in that regard (especially if you are tall), but the rest of the car?... Well.. I think our previous poster hit the nail on the head..YMMVkyfdxvisiting host "

I just saw an article on something about how chrysler has sold 1.2 million PT Cruisers since it was introduced.

""architectural"" shingles, 15 yr. labor warranty, the contracter has all these different qualifications from ""CertainTeed"" (which I think actually means something), insurance, etc. etc.Then an estimate for $2100 from Home Depot, which I read in CR gets low ratings for their ""installation services"".

"andre1969","August 2007"," I thought it was roomy up front, but they sacrificed a lot of rear seat room, it seems. The thing also seemed plagued with blind spots.

"kyfdx","August 2007"," That sounds like a good price..If your roofing is bad, that could cause the leaks, even if your roof structure is good. Are the boards exposed from underneath? If not, they won't know for sure, until they strip the old roof. As long as your framing/trusses are good, repairing the roofing plywood won't be expensive, anyway. The ice-dam is a plastic-type product that adheres to the lower portion of the roof... Usually the last three feet up from the eaves, underneath the shingles. If ice builds up in your gutters, water running down your roof is sometimes forced backwards, uphill on your roof and can leak under your shingles... The ice-dam seals the bottom portion of the roof to prevent this.It sounds like you are getting a thorough, professional roofing job. If your garage roof is exposed from the inside (no finished ceiling), then some of that might be over-kill. But, I'd rather have that, than a cheap, shoddy job.Good luck!kyfdx "

One of my friends was thinking about getting a new vehicle soon, and at that point had it narrowed down to an Xterra or an Equinox. I was hoping he'd check out a Caliber, too. Even though it's smaller than the other two, I figure it was still bigger than the '98 Tracker he had been driving! He never did check out the Caliber, and ended up getting an Xterra.

Many in here have posted about what great deals they've gotten.I feel your pain on the roofing situation. Hurricane Wilma destroyed 1/2 of our roof and Allstate reluctantly replaced the whole thing with a more expensive barrel style roof. We had a slate tile roof before, so was kinda surprised when they said we had to go with the barrel tile. Come 4 months later and they drop us for the homeowners policy. Can't honestly say it was because they sprang for the new roof and new gutters, but makes me wonder. Supposedly they dropped thousands of South Florida homeowners.One last thing, we switched from Allstate for our car insurance to 21st.com. Very easy process with a savings of well over $200.00. Another good thing is since all the kids live away from home, we can put them on the policy 4 times a year for a month each time when they come home for school vacations.

I think its a shame.Yeah, but with the way fuel prices are these days, Chrysler really needs something more fuel-efficient in their fleet than the Caliber. That's why I think they should have gone and offered a sedan-type direct replacement for the Neon, in addition to the Caliber. I think the Caliber's just too nichey to pull in truly huge volume. It's like a Matrix/Vibe or a Focus wagon/5-door, just heavier. It'll have it's market, for sure, but I still think a sedan version would have really helped boost sales.And for all the hoopla over the PT Cruiser, which I do think is kinda cool, I just look at it as a Matrix/Vibe or Focus wagon contender, just wrapped up in cool retro sheetmetal.

Where I see the Cruiser and Matrix being different is that they are not just wagon versions of existing cars, like the Ford or Saturn. And the Cruiser predates the yota/pontiac twins, so i don't think you'd be remiss saying it created a niche ... although not much different than the cute utes, it does seem to be perceived as such.While I agree Chrysler may need to offer a more economical car, I think it would have to be of a completely different design. I don't see the Caliber working as a sedan. Its just too darned tall for its other proportions. "

OSB is now about as cheap as it has ever been (@ $6/sheet for the 7/16""), and then have a nice set of shingles put on top of the new OSB. You will have fewer joints with the 4'x8' sheets of OSB than you will have with a bunch of 1x8s.

We were up there to see some friends a couple of months ago and traffic was terrible - for Huntsville.Anyway to stay OT I did buy two vehicles while we lived there. The first was an 01 F-150 SuperCrew. That's the one I should have kept and still be driving today. But being a Chronic Car Buyer.... We also bought our first Honda Civic there at Jerry Damson Honda. We loved that car as well, but two kids ""necessitated"" something bigger. Both buying experiences in Huntsville were very good and each dealer's service department was top notch. Especially at Damson Honda. They were one of the few I've ever dealt with that always seemed to go the extra mile for you.How does that play out for the rest of you guys and ladies?

"oregonboy","August 2007"," I know this is off topic, but I just have to reply to the endorsement of OSB (Oriented Strand Board) as preferable to the original solid-wood sheathing. If you must replace some or all of the original sheathing, spend a few extra bucks per sheet and buy real PLYWOOD, not OSB.True story: a roofer who was working on replacing the roof over our company's warehouse commented that we had specified plywood, rather than OSB. He said that he supplemented his income by buying ""distressed"" homes and fixing them up to either sell or hold onto as rentals. He replaced the roofs on the houses that he intended to sell with OSB. If he planned to keep the house, he would use plywood.Plywood can get wet, from a minor leak, dry out and survive. OSB, (unless it has been vastly improved in recent years), will swell up like a sponge and not return to its original state when it drys.If you leave an untreated piece of exterior plywood out in the weather for a year, it will turn grey, but it will retain most of its strength. Given the same treatment, a piece of OSB could be crumbled with your bare hands. (You might get splinters though!) :P james "

I would've figured that the OSB would hold up better because of all the glue, composites, or whatever other crap is in there!About 11 years ago, I built a doghouse with OSB for the sides and roof. I put it under my grandmother's deck, and intended to put shingles on it, but never did. One of the dogs is long since dead, and the other is getting old and never uses it. Over the years, a bunch of other junky has accumulated under that deck, and one of these days I'll have to get under there and clean it all out. I'm kinda curious to see how fragile that OSB has gotten. Even though it was under the deck it still would've gotten plenty wet over the last 11+ years. "

BIG car, would hold 4-5-6 people, & the trunks on those late 60's FS GM cars were immense.Built like a tank, I'd own one.....The Bonneville was a step up from the Catalina, and longer overall. 124"" wheelbase versus 121"". They stuck it all in the rear, basically in that area behind the back seat but before the rear axle, so it didn't give you any more room in the passenger cabin. They also added some length to the back of the Bonneville, resulting in the car being something like 223"" long, compared to 215"" for the Catalina. So Bonnevilles did end up with larger trunks than Catalinas. The Bonneville also had a nicer interior, with upgraded vinyl, nicer armrests, more chrome, carpeted lower door panels, and, I think, a front seat center armrest. I think the plood on the dash was a richer texture, too. IIRC, they also put fender skirts standard on the Bonneville (yuck!), and I think it came with a standard 400-4bbl with 325-330 hp, versus a 290 hp 400-2bbl for the Catalina.Here's a pic I took of it back in April.

"sandman46","August 2007"," Having no payments is a wonderful thing. We always pay cash for both cars, hence the two economy cars we drive, and it's a great feeling. If Mazda & Honda had had super low financing rates when we bought, maybe we'd change our minds. But they didn't...and we didn't.Keep the Saturn and squirrel that money onto the back of your house mortgage, you'd be surprised at how nice that works. Wife did that when the kids were infants and I worked mucho hours of overtime. She surprised me in 1995 with a paid off house! All she said is she got real creative and we left it at that.That's probably why I've gotten so fiscally responsible and usually advise others in here to be conservative. Sure, I'd love to drive my dream car, the '07 Acura TSX. Perfect size, a little longer than my Civic and much nicer creature comforts. I also really like the Volvo S40, basically just like our Mazda 3.

Keep the Saturn a year or two longer or until you spend more than $1,000.00 in a few months on repairs, or pick your own repair threshold and then jump.

"michaellno","August 2007"," Welcome to another Saturn fan!How do you like your Aura? With all the time I've spent at our Saturn dealer the past couple of weeks, I've been looking closely at the Aura.A couple of things really bother me, though:1) narrow trunk opening .. there is as much room in the trunk as my L (I think), but because the decklid is so much shorter, it looks like it would be tough to get larger items into the trunk2) the hard plastic arm rests on the doors seems to be a true cost cutting measure3) if I were to get an Aura, it would probably be an XR, as I really like the 3.6L in the VUE and would love to see what it would do with a few hundred less pounds to haul aroundDoes your mom like her VUE?sandman: as I get older (43 now), I am getting more fiscally conservative, so I am really, really trying to hang on to the L300.On our way home from the dealer after making the deal on the VUE, we talked about the parameters for keeping or trading the L. A few hundred dollar repair or maintenance a few times a year would be OK, but several consecutive months of it might be the tipping point.I know that I'll have a few relatively expensive maintenance items coming up over the next couple of years -- timing belt, new tires -- and I'll prepare for them.I'm just hoping to avoid some large repair bills like I've unfortunately had in the past year and a half.

"andre1969","August 2007"," Millspd, I'm kinda curious about your impressions of the Aura, as well. I like the looks of them...in fact, I think it's the first GM car in awhile that has actually aroused my interest.The last (and only) new car I bought was a 2000 Dodge Intrepid, but if I get another new car, I want to go with something a bit smaller/economical. I've heard the base Saturn take some flak for having a pushrod V-6, but the 3.5 still seems pretty powerful from what I've heard. And I've also heard that it's tight in the back seat for 3-across seating. That's something that used to be a concern for me, but I think it's been about 2-3 years since I've even had 3 people in the back seat of a car!I've also noticed, like Michaell, the older I get, the more financially conservative I get. Okay, sometimes I can be downright cheap!  (like when the dog had that fatty growth that we didn't know if it was a tumor or not, so I just slipped him a roofie, cut it off with a kitchen knife, and then duct taped him up...okay, just kidding there!) So while I'm trying to hold onto what I have for as long as possible, if I do get a new car, it's not going to be anything extravagant. Probably just something like a Saturn Aura XE, versus the XR. Or maybe a 4-cyl Altima. "

I just drove my wife's car for a carwash, and checked out the armrest as I really hadn't paid much attention before. Seemed ok to me but I usually drive with my left leg elevated a bit and rest my arm on that.We looked at the XR, but I didn't want to spend that much and the paddle shifters were ""stupid"" per my wife. So that made that easy, but I probably would have enjoyed them.My Mom is very pleased with her Vue. The main criteria was finding a vehicle that she could easily get in and out of. We'd started out by looking at minivans -- figured those flat floors made for easy exit and entry -- but she thought they were all too big, even the SWB ones. So we started looking at small SUVs and she just fell in love with the 2008 Vue, particularly the interior. It is really nice and definitely represents an upgrade from the interior of the 2002 I had -- austere is probably the kindest word for its interior.So, yeah, we have bought our share of Saturns. Dealership has been great as usual.I wouldn't mind having a Saturn myself, but nothing really grabs me right now except the Outlook and I just don't need a vehicle that big. "

I think two in back would be tight if you had two people like me in front, at least in terms of legroom. When we were looking at cars, my wife and I looked at the Malibu Maxx as well. We have one of those in our fleet at work and it has a very good amount of legroom in back thanks to the movable rear seat and I love the hatchback flexibility. But, alas, after her first test drive she asked me just exactly how old is the Maxx's interior. She found, and I agree, the Aura's interior to be much nicer. I felt bad for the Chevy dealer.

It came loaded, except leather, and I had that put in aftermarket. 63K miles and 4 more payments. It's had its share of troubles (BCM, front axle seal, brakes) but it does everything I want it to and still it gets about 24MPG.2004 VUE AWD V6 - Bright Blue. Was wife's car until earlier this week. We looked hard at the Hyundai Santa Fe but the polymer panels sold her. That, and the 250HP Honda engine and the $3750 rebate.2001 L200 - Black. Bought used but on the same day as the VUE, this one is driven by my (step)son. 5-speed, it now has (I think) close to 150K on it. He's done a bit of work to it (shocks / struts, transmission rebuild) but he drives it all over Utah (lives in Provo, g/f in St. George) and it still runs strong.2006 ION 2 - Storm Gray. Bought 14 months ago, now has 8800 miles on it. Driven by (step)daughter, who we felt needed a reliable car to get to and from college, 100 miles away. Automatic but fairly well loaded (ABS, sunroof). She calls it ""Steve"" and will probably drive it until it falls apart -- which, at the rate she puts on miles, will be in 15 years or so.2008 VUE XR - Techno Gray. Bought earlier this week. The '04 VUE died on us on Sunday and had it towed to dealer; dealer couldn't find problem. We picked the car up from the service department on Monday evening and went over to sales and traded it in.The more I look at the Aura, the more I like it. However, I'm just not sure that my next car has to be a sedan. I'm hoping to get another few years of service out of my L and get something more sporty. I am encouraged by the press the Aura is getting, however.I wouldn't consider myself a GM guy. Growing up in California, imports were the thing. Mom drove Toyotas, mostly and Dad has a '70 Chevy pickup he bought new. I had a Pontiac Sunbird in HS and college, but after graduation, I had a couple of Hondas, an Isuzu and a Nissan.After moving to Colorado (and got married again), I had a series of Fords and 1 VW before starting the Saturn thing.

"millspd","August 2007"," ooh, I like that bright blue. That color looks good on GM's SUVs IMO.

I wasn't sure if that was accurate?My parents were Ford and GM folks, though the car my Mom traded in was a Camry and my wife and I traded in a Civic that we (alright, maybe just me) were never quite happy with. The car was fine mechanically, but it had several annoying body integrity issues that never seemed to get fixed right. I think we would have been happier with a V6 L series. We'd originally gone in because of the great deals being offered on the L100s (think there was a special edition one or some such of it) but we really wanted a power seat and some other extra stuff we got on the L200 for not much more. My Vue was a good car -- it was the first V6 option and I thought it was adequate in the car. Nothing compared to the V6 you all had, but it worked ok.One of my favorite memories of my Vue is getting invited to a Vue clinic at a GM center in the Chicago burbs and spending the day talking with Saturn engineers and other folks about the car. They fixed a misalignment in my sunroof right there which was pretty cool and I got to drive an Ion too before they hit the dealerships. "
"andre1969","August 2007"," I read somewhere that the Ions had extra long front seat tracks, or maybe just the drivers seat, that allowed for more legroom upfront than other cars of its size. I wasn't sure if that was accurate? It's been awhile since I sat in an Ion, but I do remember the seat going back pretty far. I'm kinda tall, 6'3"", with long legs, so if it has bad legroom, that's usually the first thing I notice. I kinda remember the seat being low to the floor though, and somewhat flat.Isn't the Chevy Cobalt basically the same thing as an Ion underneath? I remember the Cobalt feeling pretty comfy to me up front, better than the Ion. But then, perhaps they've improved the Ion's seats in more recent years, too? "
"millspd","August 2007"," mmmmm, I don't remember the seats that well in the Ion -- it's been a while. :-)you are right, Andre, about the Cobalt being built off the same platform as the Ion. I sat in a 2006 or 2007 2 door Cobalt on showroom floor while my Impala was being serviced and feeling pretty cramped. It was disappointing cause I remember the old Cavliers, particularly the 2 doors, being really comfortable me. Of course, it's cause the seat was mounted so low to the floor it was like sitting in a bathtub. but I liked it! ;-) "
"corvette","August 2007"," The Aura XE has a more powerful engine than the base Altima... The 3.5 liter is not going to win any awards for refinement, but provides an amount of forward propulsion I consider adequate for a midsize sedan (I'd consider the four in the Altima, Accord, Camry, etc., a little slow). I drove my uncle's Mini Cooper S today. Would have made a ""money shift"" into first if I had been driving it hard during that shift... Maybe my memory is sketchy, but I seem to recall that the shifter on my BMW wouldn't easily move into first if you weren't almost completely stopped. The Mini was fun, but after having a long string of four-door cars as daily drivers, I think I've been spoiled by their practicality. "

"sandman46","August 2007"," I just got home from driving the 3s, as the wife and kid #2 took the train up to Orlando for about five days. I'll now get plenty of seat time in it. If you want a small car that can really move, get the 2.3 3s...it has great low end torque and the shifts are unnoticable up the power band. It's a hungry animal for the petrol so just keep that in mind. The interior is just o k and surprisingly, the front chairs don't seem to upset my chronic back condition. The amount of blackness in the cabin is a bit too much and eventhough the a/c is cold, it really has to work sometimes. But after two years and 34k miles, the car just feels old. They finally got rid of the rear panel annoying vibration after three tries, so all is quiet now. The rear brake dust is very irritating also, just went out & cleaned the rear alloys. It's odd, they get it worse than the fronts, identical with the Volvo S40 which is the same car basically. Poor brake design.The Civic is a great car and I love it. The mpg's are great and everything is just where it should be. I would only wish for a schoosh more power and smoother shifts going from 1st to 2nd to 3rd, not as seemless as the 3. The seats are comfortable and since I added alloys from EBAY, I love my Honda!We got both cars for about the same price, within $15.00. The wife loves the size and the power though the mpg's aren't as stellar as the Civic. You can't go wrong with either choice really.The Sandman  "
"guss","August 2007"," Sounds like I should be leaning more towards the Civic. I do a 50 mile round trip commute each day so the mpg's are important. I know neither is going to be confused with a Lotus so I can live with the poor acceleration.I had heard about the poor a/c on the 3 and the color combination I like, black on black, will not help . I like the style of the 3 a little better than the Civic though. I was surprised though that the one Mazda dealer I went to really was not dealing much on them. I guess they are still hot even after 4 years.I need to get some more seat time in a Civic, the one test drive I went on was only 10 minutes because it was a busy Saturday. I did like the seats more in the Civic, and it had a little more legroom. "
"stickguy","August 2007"," Take a look at the 3i also. It has the 2.0 instead of the 2.3, and 16"" wheels. Not really much slower, and certainly comparable to a civic, but gets a bit better MPG.Not too long ago CR did a comparison test of small cars, and I think the 3i actually got the best MPG (beat the civic, but it might have been the prior model).Has a better ride too with the 16"" tires.

"bdc2020","August 2007"," Well yesterday afternoon, I just purchased my first Honda...actually my first foreign car ever.I've never been disappointed or had issues with domestics, but only Dodge is left making minivans and we don't like their 2007's and their 2008's are just rolling in and not discounted enough yet (besides the fact that they are totally brand new without a little history).Anyway, we got a 2007 Honda Odyssey EX for $24,400 + doc + TTL. I think we could have gotten more off, but, I'm still happy. We keep our cars till they die so in the scheme of things I'm happy still.Salesman was great, finance guy was not. He was unhappy because I wouldn't consider his finance terms (it was only .25% less than mine and not worth the hassle of watching over his paperwork, etc.)Funny/sad story about Toyota that is related. We were all set on the Sienna. Found one of the last 2007's with the option package we wanted that was within 30 min of us. Drove out all ready to buy. Van was there, looked great. Took it on a test drive. Transmission was bad! Salesman couldn't believe it. Did it to both him and I.When van would shift into 2nd (either upshift or downshift) - it would first catch neutral...rev to like 6,000...and then slam into 2nd! Brand new Toyota. Nice.So that left us with only 2008 Toyotas that were coming in around $2,600-$3,000 more than the 2007 Hondas and just not worth it (although we STILL like the Toyota better for 2 reasons: 8th seat is huge and seats flip forward to make getting into the 3rd row easier).I sure hope my first experience with a foreign car goes well!

Toyota's 2008's are already arriving on dealer lots though, and that's not so with the Honda's. I think they have another month before that. "
"michaellno","August 2007"," Unfortunately, front plates are required by law here in Colorado.Regarding the factory hitch .. yeah, I'm glad we got it, but I'm not entirely sure what to attach to it.Was on a website looking at flatbed trailers ... could use it in place of a pickup truck bed when needed. A small one (5' x 8') runs $1000-1500, but I have no idea where to put it when I don't need it. I live in a covenant controlled neighborhood, so leaving it outside isn't going to fly with the HOA. Could put it in the garage, but that means that my car would be outside. Could find a storage lot to store it, but is it worth the money?I guess the same would be true for anything we would by (pop up tent trailer, etc.). "
"stickguy","August 2007"," 2 options really.1) figure out how to tilt it up against the back wall of the garage, if there is enough room2) just rent one from U haul on the occasion that you need it. I am guessing that it isn't something you will use very often?They are pretty cheap to rent for a day, so that is probably a better option if you are only using it 1-2 times per year. At least more cost effective, if not quite as convenient.Oh, there is a fine option 3). Find a friend that has one, and borrow it when needed!The other nice feature of the hitch is getting a hitch mounted bike rack, if you are into that kind of thing. Much better than hanging them on the back of the car.You can also get a hitch mounted gas grill for tailgating! "
"1racefan","August 2007"," I am in the same boat as you - looking for a small utility trailer. I don't know if you have ""Northern Tool & Equipment"" stores in your neck of the woods, but they sell a 4x8 trailer that folds up, and stands on end for storage. They have a website you can look at it on. It is a pretty light duty unit, and you have to put a plywood floor, and sides on it yourself. I am trying to decide whether to buy something like that, or something a little more heavy duty. I was trying to figure out where to store a trailer also - we have an HOA controlled neighborhood as well, which is why I started looking at this folding one at Northern Tool. We recently bought a piece of wooded property out in the country we are going to eventually build on (about 15 miles away). If I buy a trailer that is a little more heavy duty, that doesn't fold up, I will probably just tuck it into the woods at our new lot, and maybe chain it to a tree with either some chain, or aircraft cable.

"british_rover","August 2007"," Personally, I think it's awful. What were they thinking? Doesn't making the wheelbase that much longer defeat the whole purpose of the vehicle?It really depends on the situation, obstacle and terrain. In some cases a longer wheel base is better then a short wheelbase. For example this video Shows that very concept.Ignore the fact that the guy driving the Defender doesn't know what he is doing and hasn't aired down his tires. The H1 with its much longer wheelbase and track has better control and traction in this situation.Conversely...http://www.overlandexperts.com/That is the website for the off-road driving school we use. His course is incredible with a mix of man made and artificial terrain from mild all the way up to guaranteed body damage. We use his medium difficulty course which would be a struggle for most stock vehicles but is doable with most stock Land Rovers. The course looks wicked hard but with the proper guides and drivers who will pay attention to those guides you can get through with out breaking anything.So far we have never had anyone cause damage to their car that a tech couldn't fix on site. Their is one section on Bruce's most difficult course that as far as I know only a his D90 can go up. I think he calls it the steps of doom or some such funny name. They are large, high, 90 degree rock ledges almost exactly 90 inches apart so a vehicle needs to have around 90 inches of wheelbase plus insane approach and departure angles in order to go up the steps. No H1 has ever been able to go up those steps because its suspension system is all wrong for that kind of terrain and the wheelbase is way too long. "

The Audi turns around 2300 RPM at 70 MPH--I think the Jetta VR6 turned around 3000 (with fuel economy to match). Other automatic cars I've driven do exhibit irritating behavior when going uphill with the cruise control activated. The worst was a Chevy Malibu (which was otherwise surprisingly decent to drive), which hunted very badly, straying +-5 MPH from the set speed.I'd rather not deal with a stick shift on a daily driver, but would want one if it were predominately a weekend/road trip car.

"mfletou1","September 2007"," They're hitting me again...and my wife...bad...so far, we're ok...deep breaths.Here's the deal--I'm actually great. Last year I traded my 2002 Intrigue for a Toyota Camry Hybrid. My Intrigue was almost paid off, had about 45k but was deteriorating rapidly. It kept dying (literally...like everything, engine, electronics, power steering, etc) at high speeds. Dealer had a hard time figuring out the problem. It was still under the 5/60k Oldsmobile warranty. After $4k of warranty work, they think they fixed it...but I just didn't trust it.Plus, I live in Northern VA, and we bought a condo quite a ways from where I work on Capitol Hill. In VA, hybrids get HOV lane access...so I starting thinking about it and was able to convince all involved that it made sense to buy a hybrid.So last June, I purchased a 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid--at that time standard with an awesome 6 disc system, bluetooth, etc--basically XLE level--and an optional sunroof. Got a great deal for $1k under MSRP at Fitzgerald (only dealer anywhere that was under MSRP for a car in very high demand), a $2600 federal rebate, and $7300 for my Intrigue. All in all, it made a lot of sense.I LOVE my car. I don't want to drive anything else...but I've already put 27k on it. At this rate, it will have 100k in 4 years.So I try to use my wife's car for family outings on the weekends. We have a 7 month old, and we find ourselves lacking space at time. Its her car that's causing our demons to emerge.She's got a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx. It, too, has only 27k. We owe about $5k on it, and it was appraised for $9500 at CarMax. Its settled down some now, but we had quite a few problems with it. Its had its rotors resurfaced 7 times, and is on its third set. Also new pads. Some plastic trim pieces in the cabin have fallen off. In short, its not a very well made car. Now, we only paid $16k for it NEW--and that was with an option package that added curtain airbags and a few creature comforts. But, well...we just aren't feeling it for this thing anymore. I know the mileage is low, but...the rear seat room is great, cargo area is so-so, driving dynamics kind of suck.We want a crossover. I'm done with GM...(long story even besides my Trig and the Maxx), so that's out and we REALLY can't afford the Lamda twins anyway. We found ourselves at some dealers last weekend looking at some crossovers--Veracruz, Highlander, CX-9, Taurus X and Pacifica. Oddly, my wife liked the Pacifica the best. Found a totally tricked out '07 with dvd, heated seats, bluetooth, backup camera...for $28k off a $35k MSRP. Pretty damn tempting. EXCEPT--I have a reliabilty concerns for a Chrysler product. I liked the CX-9 the best...but its pricey. The Highlander just plain seems overpriced. The Veracruz is nice, but cargo area is pretty tight, and to actually get one with what we want is too expensive, and bluetooth is not even available.So I suppose there's nothing out there for us. For the first time, I've kicked around the idea of a lease, since my wife drives low miles...but even that Pacfica is $480 a month with nothing down, and I can't see putting like $4k down and still pay $360 a month and not own anything.Today, I noticed some great lease deals on an Outback. Doesn't get us a crossover, but deft. an upgrade over what she's got. But on the ""good deal"" model, of course, no auto climate, and very few other creature comforts.So I guess we're not doing anything...but man, the itch is bad! "
"corvette","September 2007"," $7300 sounds like a generous offer on the Intrigue, even given the lowish miles. As for not being a CCBA, the 4.3-liter V6 in my grandfather's 1996 Chevrolet S-10 recently started making an internal bearing noise (at ~130,000 miles). After being quoted (in his words) a very attractive price on a brand new Colorado, he decided to put a remanufactured engine in the S-10. Chacun ? son go?t! "
"mfletou1","September 2007"," Yeah, and I thought that $9500 was pretty good for the Maxx, also. That's kind of what got me thinking...The wife also likes the Tribeca...there's a couple of old 07s lying around with a lot off MSRP..yeah, I know, old engie, premium fuel.... "

That car was a disaster! It ran OK for the first year then everything started falling apart. The alignment was off from day one and the dealer just rotated the tires to fix the problem... the motor used more oil than the Exxon Valdez... truck struts broke, front passenger side leaned, dash air controls burned out.. etc, etc. I had to have it towed 2 or 3 times in 3 years of ownership. GM NEVER AGAIN!!!

"michaellno","September 2007"," As I mentioned on Friday, the initial damage estimate is $2300, and that is before any disassembly is done.The L is worth probably $8-9K in trade, so the repair bill will have to go up quite a bit in order for State Farm to declare it totalled.The only thing I'm worried about is the A/C didn't work after the accident. There were no fluids leaking from the car, so I'm not entirely sure what happened.Got the call from State Farm; the other drivers' policy will be covering my losses as well as the rental car -- I won't even have to pay my deductible.At this point, I'm figuring 2 to 3 weeks before I get the L back. The place where I'm having the work done is quite meticulous, and I'm not in a huge rush - I'd rather have the work done right rather than quickly.My car definitely was the one better off; the other car needed to be towed, as both passenger side tires were flat, not to mention the bent front right wheel. "
"1racefan","September 2007"," micheall,I am not an insurance expert by any means, but I have a neighbor that is an insurance adjuster for an insurance company. This summer, he was telling me that sometimes, you can ask an insurance company to do what's called a ""cumulative total"". Here is my interpretation of what he was telling me (and this may not be fully correct, but worth looking into)- In your case, you would have the body shop disassemble the car without ordering any parts to get a better grasp on what all may be wrong, as well as look at that a/c system. Then, the body shop could tell you the new estimate after doing this, as well as a time frame for how long it will take. If they say it would take 3 weeks, you would multiply 21 days by the cost of the rental car per day, and add that to the estimate. If you had any other bills associated with this, you would add them in as well. Once you were to add all of the costs together that the insurance company would be incurring, you would then approach the insurance company to see if all of that exceeded the correct percentage of the vehicle's value needed in order to total the vehicle (and remind them that things may pop up in the future from this accident that they would have to pay to rectify).This may work out for you, because even though you are dealing with the other guy's insurance, it is still the same company you use, so remind them that you are their customer as well. Also remember to be the squeeky wheel, and make it clear as to what it is going to take to make you happy. "
"woodyww","September 2007"," Will be interesting to see what they determine with the A/C. My impression is that sometimes the force of the impact can cause other components--that may have been old or marginal--to fail (early), esp. if they're located near the damaged area. But if there's no visible damage, of course the ins. co. will say it's not related.....Oh, & I'd be prepared for the repairs to possibly take longer than quoted......1 hard to get part can hold things up who knows how long.(Just wanted to cheer you up a bit!).

"corvette","September 2007"," The evaporator coils for the A/C are right up front, near the radiator (looks almost exactly like a transmission cooler, to me at least). It's likely that they were bent, broken, or otherwise damaged in the crash. If there is a break in the line, all the refrigerant will be lost, and the A/C will stop working. Not sure how this situation affects the longevity of the compressor. Watch out, State Farm will try to use non-OEM parts unless you demand otherwise (and pay the difference). "
"michaellno","September 2007"," Just heard from the body shop .. the repair estimate is up to $2903, which still doesn't include the A/C repair. They have found nothing on visual inspection that could account for the A/C problems. He will keep me appraised .. they may have to take it to the Saturn dealer if the body shop can't figure it out.Was also told that the $2900 represents 28% of the value of my car, which means State Farm thinks my car is worth about $10,367. I wish I could get that much for it in trade -- 9 grand in equity would go a long way towards the purchase of a new ride.I may have to revise my opinion of my rental Fusion - if not for the anemic combination of the 4 banger and an automatic transmission, it's actually not a bad car. I fit comfortably, the sight lines are decent, it's got a large trunk (though the trunk opening is a bit on the small side). Wife has ridden in it and feels that the seats are a bit higher off the ground than the L. I was able to explain to her my issue with the short seat cushions in the VUE - of course, since she's 5'2"", she never noticed.The only thing I'm not fond of is the lack of manual control with the 6-speed automatic found in the V6 versions ... something the Saturn Aura addresses in the XR with shift paddles on the steering wheel.

Sometimes I think about going back and seeing if I can reverse the deal.I think that would really mess with the title clerks head.I did look at the 6i though, and if I had not already owned one I can see doing a 6 again.

"qbrozen","September 2007"," hmmm... i wonder if the hard starting is the same issue we had with our '03. i figure they woulda had it fixed by now. but maybe not. Anyway, popular opinion was that it had to do with the security system being slow to recognize the key. We did find that sticking the key in the ignition, then puttin on seatbelt or whatever just to wait 2-3 seconds, then turning the key helped the issue. Later on, we had a remote starter installed, which requires a spare key be mounted inside the dash for the security bypass. Having this key in the dash all the time seemed to make the hard start go away completely. So I was inclined to believe it was the key recognition issue. "

Otherwise I'll give it a few seconds before I turn the key. No big deal, I still love it, such a pleasant SUV! "
"grandtotal","September 2007"," I don't think it is a key recognition issue. I think it's a fuel pump/pressure issue. We had this problem with our Odyssey. When you get in turn the ignition to on, then put your seatbelt on etc., then turn the key to start. Should work every time. "
"qbrozen","September 2007"," If its not holding pressure in the fuel system, then that is a problem and it is correctable. That means the system is leaking down as it sits. This is a problem on 20-year old bimmers, it should not be an acceptable problem on a new car. "
"grandtotal","September 2007"," It's very common with Odysseys (and presumably Pilots, MDXs etc too). I didn't realise it is correctable.

Fill it up, and the needle goes to about 7/8 full initially. Then, after being driven a bit, the needle moves over to the full mark. Will have the dealer take a look at that as well. "

"british_rover","September 2007"," I test drove the C30 today. Borrowed one from our Volvo dealership down the street.First impressions are good. Very comfortable car plenty of power and just as fast as my MINI was when it was stock. Not as nimble as the MINI but this was a V1.0 C30 without the dynamic chassis so a 2.0 with suspension upgrade might get close to a MINI. They didn't have a manual in stock so I had to drive an automatic. Throttle response is a little on the slow side with the automatic or so I have been told. Almost no torque steer even with the Stability control off. Being a Volvo you can't turn it completely off but I am sure there is a way around that. Unless the Clubman really blows me away I think we will probably end up with the C30 next summer. Only other car I can think of looking at is a Rabbit TDI but VW still makes me nervous. Plenty of people I know lately have just had never ending problems with their VWs. "

That being said, I would not buy a saturn again. Regarding your question about getting another saturn...I'd say Voting with your wallet is dumb. You already bought half a dozen saturns... You made your point. IMHO, Be smart and get something different on the cheap and keep it a long time.Ofcourse, I am at a different stage of life right now. So your approach will be different than my perspective. I'd be happy with money in the bank and be able to take 6 months off. I am getting tired of monday morning sickness.

Partly based on my own experience owning 2 hondas, & 2 toyotas.People's problems here with saturns & chrysler vehicles have kind of turned me off to those.....(not that I was gonna buy one anyway, but.....).I think it's partly a sociological phenomenon too (had to look those words up to spell them): in fancier neighborhoods in MA, the only American vehicles you see occasionally are F/S P/U's. Most people have hondas, toyotas, maybe a suburu. Or bmw's, benzes, lexus, volvo's etc. if they spend more.For a lot of people, I think American cars aren't even considered when they go car shopping..... "
"nippononly","October 2007"," When I was car shopping late last year and early this year, I drove a few cars including the Fit, the Matrix, and the Impreza. I also included for the first time in a decade, two American cars. I drove a Focus wagon which was so awful it quickly made me understand why they have to perennially run a $2500 cash rebate on a $15K car. First and last Ford test drive for a while, I would say. And I drove a Malibu Maxx, which I thought was pretty darn good in many ways. In the end the interior was cheaper than the Matrix's and it cost a grand more, plus with the V-6 the fuel economy was on the hopeless side of mediocre. But it was better than I expected, and the push-button shifting was very responsive for an automatic. Honda automatics are definitely a crapshoot. Toyota is cheaping out in lots of not so good ways these days, which turn up in little hassles and headaches, although usually stuff that doesn't disable the vehicle. Subaru: several model years of bad wheel bearings and head gaskets in the NA 2.5. IMO the only genuinely bad brand is VW in terms of reliability, and Chrysler Group stands out for the world's cheapest interiors by far, and the rest are all neck and neck in the running. As for social standing, well, my area here in California is like yours - nobody drives American except full-size pick-ups and frame-based SUVs, although the new GM crossovers are definitely showing up here and there. To be seen in an American car is like being in a Kia - people cock their heads at you slightly and say ""don't worry, things will get better for you"". So if you worry about the opinions of others, which I don't, you steer towards the imports. "
"steine13","October 2007"," Those last two messages are very well thought out. It is interesting to me, because I live in Lansing, MI, perhaps the ultimate GM town. So a lot of people here don't want to be seen in anything but a domestic. Then there are still a lot of Hondas and Toyotas on the road, but Nissans and Mitsubishis are remarkably rare.And it really depends where you are. In Lansing itself, domestics dominate... and that is cars as well as trucks. Move out to the suburbs, and you'll find plenty imports. Go across U.S.-127 into East Lansing, it's evenly split between domestics and imports, same on Campus, more or less. Get on the freeway and drive between Flint and Saginaw, 90% domestic, and then it stays that way whenever you get out into the boonies. But of course, MI has a special place in automotive history. How is it in, say, Iowa? Personally, the only domestic ""cars"" I would buy new are the ones built by a Japanese company (Vibe)... but I did buy a Silverado last year and was quite happy with it.-Mathias "
"corvette","October 2007"," IIRC, the Malibu's shiftable automatic isn't a ""real"" shiftable automatic, and it only has four speeds. I think you can put it in 1, 2, 3, or 4, and it will lock out the higher gears (in 1/2/3), but if you floor the gas pedal or slow down enough, it will downshift. I got around 30 MPG highway when I had a Malibu LT V6 rental. I like being able to start out in second gear in the winter. You can always do that with a manual, and it's not really necessary if the car has traction control, but it's nice to have the option. "
"nippononly","October 2007"," IIRC, the Maxx had traction control at that price, which my Matrix doesn't. Of course, my Matrix is a manual so it is not an issue for me (and I'm in coastal California anyway, no snow issues here). And I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure the Maxx I drove had push-button shifting on the steering wheel. I'm not sure, I could be confusing it with an Aura XR I test drove last year, but I'm pretty sure it did. It certainly isn't DSG, I know that, and it is only 4 speeds, but very responsive and geared well for the output of the engine I thought. "

When I bought it, I rarely had passengers, but since I'll ski anywhere, anytime, everyone now likes to tag along. The Outback has no more seat room. The Sienna could also eliminate my elaborate and perpetual roof rack dance, leaving the roof solely for boats only.Steve &#150; I like the picture of the canoe on your van. Looks a little more proportionate than this, yes?Anyway, one of my good friends told me that if there is one vehicle she hates, it is a minivan. Of course, she bought a cooper s with an automatic?Land Cruisers are okay, but spendy and get 12mpg. Never been a 4Runner guy; I like the current Pathfinder better but the mileage isn't much better than the LC. I know that the Sienna does not get a lot better mileage, but you sure get a lot of space and utility in exchange. I have not excluded the Tribeca, maybe Pilot, maybe the Big Outback (Taurus X GASP :surprise: )though is it worse to say you drive a minivan or say you drive a Ford? "
"steine13","October 2007"," Disproportionate my foot.How 'bout this: http://www.msu.edu/~steine13/vibe.htmlFWIW, the Mercury Villager is a good van for the money. Only problem is rust, so it depends on where you live. But it's the best value in vans that i know of.The Sienna AWD locks you into run-flat tires, as far as I know. I wouldn't buy it... snow tires will be fine even for skiing.BTW, is that the large solo tripper that Wenonah builds? The Voyager or whatever it's called, one size and a lot of volume up from the Advantage, but about as fast? Looks like a heck of a boat, and in fine shape. -Mathias "

My friends are strong paddlers, and are usually 2 up in Sea Clippers. So I need all the help I can get to keep up. Those OT's you have are pretty big boats; what's the gunwale width on one of those?Supposedly, people have put regular tires on the awd Sienna rims, so that's an option. Here in WA, many roads (usually the ones leading to where I want to ski) can become 'chains required' without awd, so having awd can be a pretty nice thing. "

I appears that their lot guy is quite tall because all the drivers' seats were set far back, making the comparison possible. It looked like there was maybe 2 inches between the seat back and rear seat in the C30 vs maybe 4 inches in the S40 and 6 inches in the S60. All very tight.Anyway, does anybody know what the keypad on the center stack does? I mean, other than a phone, I can't figure out what use 0-9 would have laid out like that. If it is to plug in radio stations and climate temps, I would find that annoying, personally. And what is this new thing with the key being so high up in the dash of new cars? Does this mean I am no longer allowed to have my house key attached to it? Just another annoying ""feature."" Definitely makes a good argument for the keyless system (i'm not even sure this is available on the volvo).Anyway, the hatch area looked pretty useful.

Should make for a decent runabout.My wife made the comment that if a good lease deal came about when her lease is up (sept '08) that we could lease a C30 and she would drive it until my lease is up (may '09) and then get her a wagon and I take the C30.

"michaellno","October 2007"," Got back yesterday from our road trip to Utah. 1200 miles in 4 days. The VUE did really, really well. The MPG ranged from just under 20 to just under 24 (EPA says 16 and 22, so I'm pretty pleased). Loved the ability to downshift on the grades to keep from speeding. Quiet ride and comfortable seats - much better, in fact, than the '04 VUE. XM Radio was nice to have on the trip, though we did have a few spots where the signal dropped - mainly in the canyons and tunnels in Colorado.While in Provo, did a little bit of car shopping with the step son - his '01 L200 has almost 160K on it. Looked at Saturn (some leftover ION's), Hyundai (Elantra) and Nissan (Sentra).When did Hyundai start to make MPG a priority? We saw a leftover '07 Elantra stick a the EPA sticker said 28/36. A lot of car for under $16K MSRP. "

"corvette","October 2007"," You can get keyless start for the C30 but I assume it is the same as the LR2 or S80 in that you still have to put the key in a slot some where. Sounds like that would defeat the purpose--you're supposed to be able to start and take off driving while leaving the key in your pocket with the keyless start option, right? I found this link the other day. Apparently, these devices are common on police vehicles:http://www.secure-idle.com/It allows you to remove the key and leave the car running if the transmission is in park. You have to insert the key again before you can shift out of park. "
"lilengineerboy","October 2007"," That's nothing, the '83 Reliant I drove in the late 80s/early90s had keyless entry (locks were broken) and keyless start (ignition turned w/o keys). "
"british_rover","October 2007"," Yup but that is the way they are designed.A lot of the BMWs and MINIs are that way too. You have to pay extra to get the true keyless start and if you don't then you have to stick the key in a docking station or slot somewhere on the dash. "
"corvette","October 2007"," OK, I understand what you're talking about now. My 3-series had the ""eject box"" for the keyfob, and the keyless start was an extra option. I think I'd like the true keyless start, though. Nissan seems to be including it on a lot of models. I have a rental Sentra with the CVT while the Audi is in the body shop. I really like the CVT--in most driving, the RPMs stay low enough that the engine is eerily silent. But, the texture of the road reads through the steering wheel pretty bad--there was a constant vibration on rough roads, and it didn't feel like a tire balance problem. "
"lilengineerboy","October 2007"," My MIL Prius has that. You can have the thing in your pocket he whole time. The problem is she keeps it in her purse and the forgets to move it during car changes, etc. "
"british_rover","October 2007"," Yup that is just one of the problems with the smart keys. Another one is severely reduced battery life from the key always looking for the car. If I leave one of our Range Rover keys within six inches of the ignition for more then three or four days the battery in the key and the battery in the car will be dead. If I move it just a little farther away then that won't be a problem. Leave a smart key within the same room as a car for a few days and you have the same problem. "
"steine13","October 2007"," Loath though I am to encourage the buying of 2+ ton vehicles... I have to admit, the '04+ Sienna is one heck of a float trip vehicle.I can say this 'cuz weekend before last, we went canoeing with the neighbors, using their minivan, which has a great, and I mean *great*, roof rack with an official 150lb load limit. The rack reaches much farther forward than on my wife's '03, and the structural supports are the size of my arms -- OK, that's not saying much -- and they supported an 18' Sawyer Cruiser and a 17' Old Town Penosbscot at speeds up to 85 mph without a hiccup.On top of that, another friend assures me he can get 26 mpg by keeping his speed to 70 mph. I don't really *like* the van, mostly because it is huge, but it drives very well, and if you need something that size, it probably is the pick of he litter.I'd still do without the AWD and make sure I have a full-size spare aboard. But that's me.As far as pulling up somewhere and spending the night in the vehicle; if you have one six-footer and one short person, it can be done creditably in a Vibe/Matrix.Finally, the width at the gunwale for my Old Town boats, since lilengeneerboy asked, is 33 and 34 inches. The Sawyer I forget, probably 31-32.-Mathias "
"stever","October 2007"," I always get 78"" crossbars and never have trouble hauling two tandems side by side. Another nice thing about the minivan is that even with the low ground clearance, the racks are usually high enough that most passengers don't clunk their heads when they get out of the vehicle, unlike a sedan or wagon. If you and your paddling friends are all over 6' plus, then a taller SUV (or narrower crossbars) would solve that problem. "
"lilengineerboy","October 2007"," Its funny, we have the opposite issue. Because she is ""vertically challenged,"" it is very hard for my wife to lift her mountain bike up to the Subaru's roof level. That's how we wound up with the hitch rack. "
"stever","October 2007"," Bikes go in the minivan. :-)A couple of hours ago we tossed a Wenonah Rogue on top of a friend's camper shell on the back of his Tacoma. Took three of us to get it up there. Not an ideal shuttle rig. :P "
"tifighter","October 2007"," Bikes go IN the minivan. Preach it, brother. :P These last few posts are not doing much to dissuade me from the Sienna idea, that's for sure. I found a used 04 LE AWD, 40K, Toy certified with powertrain warranty to late 2010, cosmetically very good to excellent inside and out...dealer is asking $21K. That's about $2-3K over KBB retail, but any Toyota awd/4wd (land cruiser, tacoma, etc.) seems immune to sanity anyway. Thinking about giving it a look. Best case scenario new locally for same LE awd so far is around $28-29K. New ones have a stronger engine. Hard to swallow the idea of buying something used that cost more than my Forester did new, but I guess that means they hold their value, right? Sheesh, even Pilots drop value more than that... "
"lilengineerboy","October 2007"," I can't bring myself to put a muddy mountain bike inside my car. Even a road bike gets grungy after a ride.That said, when my family would go from SB to Mammoth every summer when I was growing up, the bikes would be inside the van. Once we got there, we strapped on this cheesy Hollywood rack and used that to go from trail to trail.I would probably be more inclined to rent the minivan 1-2x a year for those types of trips then have to drive something like that on a daily basis. Of course, I have an Accord right now and that is about the boringest car ever to me too, so I might just be picky. "
"nippononly","October 2007"," Locating an LE AWD is a find, too. Most of the AWD Siennas they sell near me are the fully loaded XLE and Limited models, with stickers as high as $40K.My friends have an '05 FWD with that same 3.3L, and it is more than enough power even loaded with seven people and some gear. You have to take it easy on the highway, though, or else you won't manage more than about 24 mpg. I would imagine the 3.3 would be plenty of power even with the added weight of the AWD. Now that it has the 3.5, it has become the fastest minivan of the flock, but I'm not sure what the point of that is... "
"stever","October 2007"," Dirt goes in the minivan. I buy stuff to use it, not coddle it.

If you're chronic, you probably care more about resale value than me.Ok, I'll quit now.  "

"nippononly","October 2007"," Don't ALL dealers regardless of brand make a lot more profit on their used car sales than on their new car sales? "
"british_rover","October 2007"," Typically yes and that is even more true of big mass market volume dealers like Toyota stores.A lot of Toyota new car operations are run on the idea that all they want is volume. They want to sell more cars, to get more allocation to earn more new cars to sell more cars so that they have more service customers and more trade ins.They run the new car side at a pretty steep loss and make part of it up with used car sales. The rest of the loss and all of the profit is made up on the service/parts side. A 60, 70, 80, 90 possibly even 100 percent profit margin is made on the service/parts side. "
"tifighter","October 2007"," Yeah, Toyota dealers are usually on the high side to start, then only go higher on the certified stuff. However, Toy dealers don't seem to play $x over invoice on awd Siennas since they are hard to find. It seems to be more $x off msrp. Plus, 07's (and their incentives) are gone around here.There are 2 local dealers that still have a number of 07 Pilots, and Honda still has a $3k incentive on them. It would be worth looking into, although they don't float my boat on paper as much as the Sienna. The interior is not as useful, mileage is questionable (input, Jolie?), roof access is taller, and the base LX awd doesn't come with darn roof rails! They should, however, be more willing to do invoice less incentive or better type of deal. A Pilot should hold its value pretty well, right? "
"oregonboy","October 2007"," possibly even 100 percent profit margin is made on the service/parts sideWow, a 100% profit margin, that's pretty sweet for the service department. Of course, the only way to achieve that is by charging for for something in which you have zero cost. (In accounting-speak, gross profit = gross sales).So I guess you are saying that Toyota service departments are ""possibly"" charging for parts they don't install or services they don't perform? :surprise: Maybe there is another explanation that I am missing.  "
"grandtotal","October 2007"," Substitute 'mark up' for 'margin' and it all makes sense. "
"oregonboy","October 2007"," Oh, okay. That would be a 50% profit margin. I'm sure that most service departments sometimes exceed that. :sick: "
"british_rover","October 2007"," Yeah that is what I meant. When I ran a small service shop some of our small pats like an air filter, PCV valve, fuel filter etc were marked up well over 100 percent. A PCV valve that cost us a quarter was sold for $4.95 An air filter that cost $4.50 was sold for $11.95. For more expensive parts the mark up might only be 20-40 percent but the labor markup is almost always 100 percent. "
"corvette","October 2007"," I take back part of what I said about the Sentra. There is definitely a wheel or tire issue with the one I'm driving.

They are saying that the reason it wouldn't stay running and then wouldn't start was air in the fuel rail system. They said it was because my hubby changed the fuel filter......um, he did that AFTER it quit and wouldn't run! So they wanted to charge $51.50 for something to do with that.Then a year ago the truck had a broken vent on the driver's side, so they ordered a new dash piece and at the time it came in we couldn't get the truck in for them to replace it. So they gave us the part and said if we couldn't get it put on bring it in when we could and they would do it under warranty. Well, that didn't happen thus another $51.50 charge for them to install said part.Then of course there was the issue of the $600 tow bill on the truck for having to be towed 100 miles. UGH!In the end we are only paying for the dash piece to be put on, they are covering the rest and it makes me VERY glad I drive a Honda!

We know we want to eliminate at least 1 car payment. So that means when one of the leases is up, we buy a car for cash. In 10 months, her's will be up, and this Benz wagon is just presenting itself a bit early. It may be a ""hey, we won't find this deal again in 10 months, so we better buy it now"" kind of thing.

"akangl","October 2007"," These guys sound like the Keystone Kops of automotive repair. The mind boggles that the dealer can't even do a minor repair on their own make of vehicle. The Pilot w/Blizzaks sounds like a pretty serious Winter Vehicle.....did you get separate rims, or? Yup, pretty much, they are morons when it comes to repair. They could not figure out what was wrong with the truck, so they place the blame on the owner. I think this will be the last time they touch that truck, Anchorage is only an extra 200 miles and has a great dealer.I did buy separate rims for the Pilot. Ordered tires, rims, and tire pressure sensors from the Tire Rack, got a great price, fast shipping too. Got some nice alloy wheels that were on closeout, look real nice on it too.I was in Fairbanks all day today, lots of snow, bad roads, the Pilot never missed a beat. Even passed a semi on the way home having to navigate through 6-8 inches of snow in the passing lane, Pilot was steady and true. Really impressed with it, can't say I've driven better. Its a keeper no doubt! My CCBA days might just be over. Three months, 7200 miles, and I still can't find one single thing I don't like!!! "
"boomchek","October 2007"," Ok, the group is called Chronic Car Buyers Anonymous, just like here. Same points/level structure as here. Should be easy to find, if not, look up my profile: Maciej Buczek. Thx guys.By the way, I'm itching for a new car now as fall is usually my car buying time. The Benz C240 has been so-so. We took it down to LA and Vegas on our honeymoon and on the way back the alternator/charging system was acting up, right between Vegas and LA, so we had to to go back to LA and get it fixed ($1k later). Before that I changed the cam and crank shaft sensor, and did an oil change and that cost me $1k.Seems like anything you touch on the car is $1k a pop. For some reason I had my eye on a bare bones Hyundai Accent htchback. Good on gas, cheap to buy, low rates (0.9%), and it will help me save money over the Benz as I commute a lot now.Others cars I've been eyeing were: Dodge Charger, Mazda3 Sport, The Accent, The Fusion, Chevy Impala, the new Malibu. I'll get more serious on ti when we come back from our 3 week honeymoon. "

"boomchek","October 2007"," Yes, I remeber all the warnings from you guys about getting the car. I do like it but 1: I'm getting bored with it, and 2: it does cost a lot to run. Since I'm still young, I'd want to save some money and invest it (hence might get something barebones for now at least) instead of putting it into the Benz. Another option might be finisheing paying it off and parking it for a bit, while getting something cheap for a daily driver.I don't mind making a sacrifice for now in terms of my car status (Benz to Hyundai). The end justifies the means, I could say.I'll look closely into it when we return from our honeymoon. "

"michaellno","October 2007"," try it on the highwayI plan to, over the weekend. My commute is 20 miles long, 15+ of which are on I-25 at 65-75MPH. Am curious about the following:1) what the revs are at that speed - in my L, 75MPH equates to about 2600RPM with the 4-speed automatic.2) ride - the L has, to me, a decent balance between comfort and sportiness. I've never driven an MB or BMW, so cannot compare to those makes, but I did drive a VW New Beetle for a few years, and that was pretty harsh riding, IMO.3) comfort - the xD has a pretty upright driving position, much like the wife's VUE. The legroom seemed a bit tight, so I'll be curious as to whether I'll be comfortable or not. "

"qbrozen","October 2007"," $7500 was right (because I ran it by RWTIV folks and was told high trade-in is $6k, so I surmised $7500 is a fair price if the car is in top shape).

"qbrozen","October 2007"," Pretty high, IMHO. I mean... I look at it this way... one with quite a few options was, IIRC, leasing at around $10k off sticker (low $30k). Then they had really horrible residuals on top of that. But, for fun, let's say 50% on a 3-year lease (I believe it was like 47-48%). On a $42k car, that's $21k. So that car they are selling for $30k had a $21k residual when it came in off lease (probably more like $20k). Even with the CPO, $24k should be more than enough.Unless, of course, the true trade-in value far exceeds the projected residual. "
"british_rover","October 2007"," Unless, of course, the true trade-in value far exceeds the projected residual.I think it is the latter. I didn't check what we own those cars for but no way do we have that much markup in those cars. On a car like that we typically have 2,500-3,000 of markup after the CPO and I can typically buy a Used car we have on the lot for a little less then we own it for. If it is a very old unit, say 60 days plus, then I can buy it for several thousand less then we own it for since the company would take a bath when it goes to auction. "

"british_rover","November 2007"," I don't think the 850Rs were AWD and the S60R/V70R has a ton more hp then the regular T5 so it more then makes up for the AWD. "

HOWEVER, on the earlier geartronic models, the power was electronically limited in 1st and 2nd so severely that the cars were slower (or as slow, depending on who is measuring) from the factory than a '98 T5. I know the first year of the ""new"" Rs had that problem. I'm not sure when or if it was every corrected. "

"tifighter","November 2007"," So yesterday I went to our local car show here in Seattle. Always a fun CCBA-er activity. As some of you may recall, I was the guy struggling with the 'should a single 32 year-old guy have a minivan or CUV' question so I thought I would try the market on for size in one shot. Ideally, I'd like to keep it in the $20K-$25K range, new or low mileage used. Features I'd like:-AWD or 4WD -tiedown points (for carrying a canoe on the roof)-factory roof rails-rear legroom noticeably better than my Forester (sorry, Outback)-min. length 70 inches cargo area with seats folded down (for skis, bikes, etc.)-Max height of 73-74 inches to fit in garage (shorter is better)-Pluses include audio aux in, dual climate, adjustable lumbar, heated seats & relatively quiet at highway speedsOut in the first round:RAV4, Rogue, Vue, CRV, CX-7, Santa Fe, Liberty, Outlander, Xterra - All too small. CX-7 was closest here with a measured (yes, I had a tape measure like a nerd)68in cargo area & seemed pretty comfortable. Biggest surprise was the Santa Fe; everyone talks about how its 'almost-Pilot' size but I did not find this to be the case although it does have great under floor storage in the 5 passenger. Rogue is not about utility in any way. None of them had much for tiedowns either (yes, I crawled under all of these like a nerd); the xterra would was passable here with the optional tow hitch, but it is so tall that you'd need a crane to put a canoe on top of it. Aw, schucks-Magnum, Pacifica, Murano - On paper, the Magnum has a long enough cargo area and the low roof should be great for loading things on top. Hard to see out of like everyone says, but I could live with it. Great rear seat room. Absolutely no where to tiedown anything from the roof; why don't cars have tow hooks anymore? My old 81 Tercel back in high school even had them...why, why, why? The Pacifica smelled like a plastic experiment gone wrong onside; I couldn't get past it. The cargo area in the Murano is oddly shaped and seemed pretty unuseful, plus it too has the tiedown/tow hook issue. Great interior, though. Light at the end of tunnel-Sienna, Pathfinder, Outlook - Outlook is not really on the list as it is too expensive. But I checked it out anyhow, and it is a big step for GM. Panel gaps look good, interior is not embarrassing anymore, lots of thoughtful features, etc. Big vehicle with no tiedowns. Sienna; well, here is one of the preseason favorites and lots of room it does have. Big gold star for 70 inches of cargo room with the second row folded forward and 94 inches with the second row removed. A little disappointed with the interior as I thought the materials could be better. Almost feels too big inside! No tiedowns at all which is a shame since the factory rack looks pretty solid. Not cheap. The Pathfinder was a pleasant surprise; meets the cargo requirements, is a little shorter in height than the xterra and has some tiedown possibilities. Interior is acceptable, but gas mileage is painful. Marginal deals on used ones around here. Tete de course-Taurus X, Pilot, Tribeca - Now we are getting somewhere. The TX is nice; great room in all rows, great cargo room (76 inches long, and that's without the front passenger seat folded down), comfortable & low roof. Lacks tiedowns :mad: Lower ground clearance. But I was surprised how much I liked it. I see 07 Freestyles used here hitting $18-19K with 15k miles, leather and most the options...true, the FS has the old engine and CVT, but this seems like a pretty useful vehicle. You just know that deals will be available on the 08's soon. The Tribeca is another strong one; looks small on the outside but has good room inside (74 inches) and rear seat slides back for more legroom. Has a 'just right' feel to the size. Like that a 5 passenger version is available; I don't really need a third row, and this opens up underfloor cargo space. Has tiedown points front and rear !!!  Subies have strong awd systems, and 'Beca has better clearance than most. Spendy new but I always did like the looks of the older one anyhow. Despite the fact that the Pilot is oldest design here, that big square box seems like it would get the job done. Good room inside and comfortable, although the interior looks and feels the oldest in this group. Big square cargo area has 71 inches of length. Third row looks painful...I didn't even try. Towhooks front and rear. Likable vehicle. Pretty tall, though, and I could only afford the base model at best...a few dealers still have some 07's and their $3k factory rebates. Resale means this one doesn't make sense to buy used.From left field-Trucks (Tacoma, Frontier), Quest - Hey, you know what does score pretty well in the utility category? Trucks (duh)! I only just figured this out. Totally does not meet the rear seat requirement I set for myself, but I still got weak in the knees when I saw all those towhooks and tiedowns, 6ft bed, low range and ground clearance. The Tacoma is pretty nice inside too, with comfortable seats and a carlike interior. Plus, Tacomas are practically depreciation-proof. I had dreams of a 4-Cyl extended cab 4wd with a 5sp manual and the SR5 pack. 4Cyl Mileage would be strangely close to my current Forester, and I don't tow. Then I saw NO available side airbags. :sick: Crew Cab only, apparently. Its 2007, Toyota, pull your head of your rear. Pretty much a dealbreaker. The Frontier does have available SAB, and you can get the V6 for the price of Toy's 4cyl,and that is before the rebates. Nice available features, but the interior and seats are clearly inferior to the Tacoma. The interior just looks noisy. And even with the crew cab, the rear seat is torture. While I was at the Nissan booth, I saw a Quest sitting in a corner, with no one looking at it, and decided to crawl around it out of pity. Here's the thing, I like it a lot...interior felt nicer to me than the Sienna and the seating arrangement is nice; the second row folds down nearly flat to create a huge cargo area. No seat removal required. Lots of cubbies and storage spots but it too lacks tiedown points. Anyhow, surprised by this one...if it only came in awd...Long narrative, but CCBA-ers usually like to live vicariously through others. That's all I've got.  "

She must have been in a fine mood as I was able to convince her that a trip to the local Chevrolet dealer to see the new '08 Malibu was a nice way to spend some time.Unfortunately, there were no new Malibu's on the lot to be seen - the saleslady took my name and phone number and will call me when some arrive.So, we wandered the lot - they had an '07 HHR that was loaded, but it was an auto. Wife's first impression was that it was a bit 'strange' looking, but once we sat inside she was more amenable to it. The windows are quite small - I suspect that blind spots are an issue when driving it. She liked the seating height - one complaint she has with my L is that she has to climb in and out of it, the seats are so low.Moving on, they had a wicked black on black '08 Impala SS. Sat in that one as well - again, nice seating height for the missus, plus she thought the seats were fairly comfortable. Saleslady asked if we wanted to test drive it -- who am I to say no?Likes:1) Power - 303HP really makes it fly. Took it out on the highway and buried my right foot. Nice, nice, nice acceleration.2) Comfort - wife commented that as much as she likes to drive her '08 VUE, she's not as happy being a passenger. Not so with the Impala .. the seats were agreeably comfortable for her. Could easily see us taking long road trips in it.Dislikes:1) A 4-speed automatic? No manu-matic control? How 1990's of Chevrolet. I know that a new RWD Impala is due in a year or two, and one can only hope that it will be fitted with a proper automatic transmission.2) Very small side mirrors. Wife commented they look like half-closed eyes. Even the mirrors on my L are bigger.3) Black leather interior would be hot, hot, hot in the heat of the summer.Sticker price on the car we drove was just over $30K - when I got home I optioned one up the way I would like (no need to spend $900 for chrome wheels - polished aluminum would be just fine), then took my GM Supplier discount into account and the $1500 rebate and came up with just under $27K.Heck, the Malibu LTZ is $26K with the GMS discount factored in.Perhaps a dark blue with the tan interior ....

The other is a 2001 in silver with 80k miles. This one is on the 5th or 6th owner. He also wants $8500.

There is a limit to what I'll accept with a reconstruct. Our Ford was totalled due to vandalism and its general poor condition thus the reason I wasn't worried about its dirty title.Speaking of the Ford, we've had that thing for 15 months, put about 15k on it and its been one of the best trucks we've ever owned.

The first truck had pulled out of a local business and had to do a 3 point turn to get turned around on the road. He was blocking both lanes, she came around the corner too fast, swerved to miss him, almost hit the back of my hubby's truck (which was parked at the above mentioned business). She then continued on out of control straight at the Pilot. I was almost stopped, had my turn signal on (getting ready to pull in to the business parking lot). It was close, too close for my liking and I had really no where to go.One of the MAIN reasons I bought the Pilot was its safety rating, I researched that to death and knew it was a very safe vehicle. The air bags, stability control, traction control, and its size were also pluses. Its as small as I'll go for a family vehicle. I don't mind a small car for errands in the summer, but winter I want my SUV.There was an accident a month or so ago where a FS chevy truck lost control in the southbound lane, rolled, came across the median upside down and landed partially on an 03 Honda Pilot, both vehicles were then hit by another FS truck.

"michaellno","November 2007"," Woody will probably choke when he reads this, but I'm starting to lose a little bit of faith in my Saturn dealer.The power seat thing was no big deal --- was a blown fuse. Replaced and all is well.However, remember my tirade a couple of months ago when we got a notice from Saturn corporate about a BCM issue? We took ours into the dealer and were told that our VIN number wasn't part of that notice.Today, the new service adviser said that our car was part of that notice, so the new software fix was downloaded onto the VUE. Unfortunately, they didn't do it right, so when I hopped into it and drove off, the airbag light wouldn't go off. Never left the dealer parking lot - I turned around and went back inside to discuss the issue.Service manager told the adviser that the tech probably skipped a step that is not part of the official instructions -- when the software update is applied, apparently, they have to relink the airbag sensor to the BCM. Tech came out with his little handheld computer doo-dad, and 5 minutes later the airbag light was reset.This took place not 5 minutes after being reminded that since warranty work was done, we'd be getting a service survey. Gee, I wonder how I'm going to answer the question ""was your problem fixed the first time?""Everybody at the dealer was apologetic, but still ....On another note, I talked with my sister in San Diego today. Her husband turned in his leased 5-series and got a new car.The way the story was told, it was like ""How not to buy a new car"".The BIL was quite specific in what he wanted ... CPO 2004 330i Coupe, Black or Navy, automatic with performance package. Right.They spent all of Saturday driving to every BMW dealer in San Diego county (4 of them!), and, lo and behold, couldn't find one. Have they not heard of the internet? Sister said she was hoping that one may have been recently turned in and wasn't listed on the net.Right.Now, at the same time, my dad (200 miles north) knows the owner of the local BMW dealer. They had exactly what he was looking for, but the price tag was $31,995. Too expensive, I guess.At the last dealer they visited, they found the following:CPO 2004 330i SedanAutomaticPerformance PkgSilver with black interior30K miles - sister says it looks brand new. They bought it for $26,995, which she said was a steal. BMW FS is running a promotion - 3.9% financing and they make the first two payments.I'm not too aware of what used BMW's can bring - does anyone here know if that's a good price?I find in tremendously amusing that they got a sedan when they (well, he) wanted a coupe (they have 3 boys aged 10 and under - what was he thinking, wanting a coupe?) and in a completely different color.(After I put those quotes I realized it could sound like the engineers were working on a fix for your wife.

So if you haven't done so already, I strongly suggest a mesh insert. After the 2nd windshield incident, I also put on a hood deflector. ACK!!!! Thanks for the tips! They put gravel on the roads for traction in the winter so rock chips are a fact of life. I am a bit miffed that the chip cracked so quickly, I *might* be able to get it fixed if it doesn't move anymore. I have a feeling though that the next time I drive the car the crack will take off!

It took so long, my hands were aching. About as frustrating as putting all those addresses in mapquest, & printing out directions. 3.

The 350 also has an MP3 player that I've never usedMy biggest complaint about the 350 thus far is that it was lacking road information when I traveled to the OK panhandle back in early Oct. I guess that's Nuvi's way of telling me I shouldn't be out there. I would think much of AK wouldn't be mapped either, but maybe not...I picked our unit up for my wife who can't seem to even find her way around our town of 45,000--and we've lived here close to 20 years.

"woodyww","November 2007"," I'm a bargain hunter, so since the lowest price I saw on amazon today for the 650 was @$400, to get it nearer to $300 on costco would give me incentive to put in more time to learn how to use it.I'm also a huge believer in maps, & have every AAA map of every place I might travel to. Of course there can also be giant gaps/limitations. So I ordered a couple of Arrow atlas's/map books for S. NH & E.

"michaellno","November 2007"," I used to travel quite a bit for business (almost exclusively in the US and Canada) from the late 80's until around 2003, so I was always looking for a good set of maps.First, it was Rand McNally to the rescue .. I'd try to get something that would fit in my computer bag, but that didn't always have enough detail for individual cities (when the cities I traveled to were even there).The maps that were handed out at the rental car counter helped to some extent ... I have always been pretty good at orienting myself and have a pretty good photographic memory. Once I look at a map, I can usually remember the main aspects of it.Then, I bought a copy of ""Streets and Trips"" software to load onto my laptop, but that didn't always help when I was in the car. Once I got to my hotel, I could plan out a route to the business I was visiting .... or to restaurants, shopping and other points of interest.If I traveled a lot now, I'd almost certainly invest in a portable GPS based nav system.The VUE we bought for the wife in August has OnStar, which allows you to subscribe to the ""Directions and Connections"" functionality. We used it when we went to Utah in October. Once we told the OnStar advisor of the address, they downloaded it onto our stereo and it would tell us when and where to turn, along with arrows pointing the way. Very nice.On the car front, I am keeping the L for now. Nothing wrong with it (at the moment - knock on wood!) and I figure it's got 2-3 years of life left in it. That will put me around 100K, then we'll see where we stand at that poing.Of course, that could change if I am faced with an expensive repair. It's gonna need new tires soon, but that is a maintenance cost, not a repair one. "

"michaellno","November 2007"," Warning ... a bit of a long post ahead ...As I believe many of you know, my wife runs the early childhood program (preschool and child care) for a small school district here in Colorado. On Monday, a tragedy struck her district as the father of two of her enrolled children killed himself.While there are many unanswered questions about why this took place, all we know is that he left behind a young wife and 3 kids under the age of 5.The community is really stepping up to assist this family. According to my wife, they were living on the ragged edge before this took place; as you can imagine, with the primary breadwinner now gone, they are struggling to cover basic needs.One of those needs is transportation. Apparently, the car they had was repossessed on Sunday, so she will be in need of something to get her and her family around. The area where they live is pretty rural and there is no public transportation available.So, I mentioned to my wife that we now have a paid off car we could give them. My question to this group is ... how would this work? Do I simply transfer the ownership paperwork to her name at the motor vehicle office? I would do this once I received the title to my car, which I suspect I'll get in the next month or two.We're still waiting to see if there is somebody else in the community who has a spare vehicle that could be given to them; while rural, there is a fair amount of wealth to be found -- as an example, another parent in the program receives royalty checks for her business and is using one of them to cover the family's rent for the next couple of months.Any thoughts on this?If we were to do this, I'd find some sort of cheap lease to tide me over for the next few years.

"woodyww","November 2007"," There's an excellent article in the October 4, 2007 WSJ (I could probably e-mail it to you): ""Be Careful When Selling a Car"". It has to do with making sure the new owner re-titles & registers the car in their name, pays transfer fees, etc. ""Each state has different rules regarding proper title transfer; in our state and many others, both the seller and the buyer have paperwork to fill out to ensure the transfer is legal.""Because, if everything isn't handled 100% properly by both buyer & seller, even years later the seller could be held responsible for all manner of problems & still considered the legal owner...... In Mass., a new owner has to pay sales tax on the value the state assigns to that year & model of vehicle, even if it's sold for $1. "
"michaellno","November 2007"," Thanks for the feedback - I really appreciate it!I knew I could count on the folks on this forum to provide me with some good advice.If (and I stress if) I do this, I'll probably take ky's advice and donate it to a church first, with explicit instructions to turn it over to this specific person. Now that I think about it, the person who runs the school age before and after school program for the district is married to a minister; I'm sure he could help arrange the donation part.I hadn't thought about the tax implications, but hey, every little bit helps.woody, here in CO the plates stay with the original registered owner. There was a story in the paper earlier this year about someone who sold a used car, forgot to remove the plates, then ended up with a bunch of unpaid traffic tickets, since the new owner simply re-used the plates.bumpy, I had thought about the registration and insurance issue .. the whole community is rallying to help this family, so I suspect that there would be enough available to cover those costs, at least in the short term.In the end, we'll just wait and see if someone can pony up a spare vehicle for her to use.

I would sell it outright and give the cash to the Church to by them a lesser value car and use the rest for expenses/car insurance. This way you would get the full value of the deduction on your taxes.The reason you probably did not pay sales taxes on the sale to your son is because most states allow you to transfer ownership to closely related family members tax free.I hope it turns out well for the family.

"kyfdx","December 2007"," Not an accountant.. but.. If the charity re-sells the car, then the amount realized is the amount of your tax deduction.. However, if they are fixing it up/giving it away, then you can take the ACV of the donation. This might involve an appraisal, or the charity itself can put a value on it.The key is: You can't donate a beater worth $300 and take a $3000 deduction. If you donate a car that you could legitimately sell for $3000, then you can certainly claim that amount for a deduction. You just have to have your ducks in a row... because, the I.R.S. will definitely scrutinize that sort of thing, because of all the abuse in the past.However... your suggestion is probably the best..

As I was driving through Texas yesterday, I saw a new Ford F-250 four door pulling a Ford Bronco (same style as OJ's, but black). Anyway, as it past me going over 75 mph, I glanced over at the tow bar..... it just didn't look right. The ball on the F-250 was rather low so the tow bar on the Bronco was angled way down not really attaching evenly to the tow ball.Guess what, the Bronco came loose. After driving 45 min. to an hour after seeing the rolling disaster... I see a crushed black Bronco sitting off to the right side of the interstate. The roof was crushed and it was totally damaged. The Ford F-250 was facing towards us in the emergency lane. Apparently, he realized the Bronco came loose and turned around and was sitting next to it waiting on the police.I just can't imagine someone pulling another vehicle without a good connection. There were NO safety chains attached! Thank goodness the Bronco didn't veer left to oncoming traffic across the median.Some people are just total retards! :confuse: Mark "
"stever","December 2007"," That's scary - I always give people towing a lot of room.A few years back up in Akangl's neck of the woods, two different homemade trailers overloaded with firewood fell apart on the highway within a couple of weeks of each other. Another friend of mine was using a too small ball hauling a load of truck canopies one day, and the trailer passed him going downhill on a two lane. No safety chains there either. Amazingly no one was coming the other way, and the trailer hit some soft flat dirt and rolled to an easy stop. The trooper showed up, shook his head and told my friend to get the trailer out of there. "
"woodyww","December 2007"," Thanks, altho Last night & today I started having a bad case of both Seller's Remorse, & Moving Phobia.Not about selling my dump of a house (altho I suspect I may have sold too cheaply; it sold in 2 weeks, what does that tell you?). More about the stress of ""moving house"", as the Brits say, after wrecking my back again this year doing leaf removal for 8 weeks on my giant yard, esp. in Winter. However the buyer's giving me until 3/15 to vacate. But where to: one or another of those nice old historic seaport towns on or near the ""N. Shore"" of Mass. Thinking of getting a house ""in-town""; w/in walking distance to restaurants, etc. Maybe buying an ""Antique"", circa 1740 thru maybe Victorian era.The stress of buying & selling real estate puts doing car deals in perspective.....for me. But here's the basic trade: 1950's era deteriorating condition small ""cape on a slab"", in an expensive suburb near Boston. To a much nicer, way better condition, way cooler house, 40 miles north, still in a great but more interesting town, for about the same $$$$.......... "

Although she did add on a comment about probably not being for a while...I imagine if I brought home a nice loaded mid-size crossover, like a Verecruz, Highlander, Tribeca or MDX, and somehow hid how expensive they are, she could be swayed.

This by someone who shops 'till they drop when buying a used car, or a set of rims or a leaf blower.

"stickguy","December 2007"," The local BMW dealer (that just built a new sales palace that I have been meaning to check out) sent a postcard yesterday. They are offering 2.9% + they will pay the first 2 payments on any 2004 CPO.

He paid something like $26K for it.I was poking around on the BMW CPO web site and found an identical car here in Denver for $26.4K. The only difference between what my BIL bought and what's here in Denver is that his is an automatic, while the one in Denver is a stick.

"qbrozen","December 2007"," I was looking at this today. I don't know if the inflated price is necessary. It seems to me BMWFS is paying the 2 payments, no? So why should the dealer care what kind of deal you cut.(?)But how long is that 2.9% for? I read one post on another board that claims 2.9% for 48 months, 3.9% for 60 months, and 4.9% for 72 months. If that's true, that's pretty good. Heck, I wouldn't even be adverse to 72 months at that rate. Local dealer shows an '04 330Ci coupe with sport, premium, automatic, and 37k miles for $26,995. Hmmmmmm..... very tempting. Or a similar sedan with, IIRC, 27k miles for $26k. That would still be a bigger payment than I have now on my Accord, though. not to mention all my negative equity. "
"michaellno","December 2007"," I think my sister told me they got 2.9% for 60 months, but that may not be accurate. They financed for 60 months, I think, and have a payment in the $400-500 range.

But, I would have thought that any German car over 100K would cost some serious $$$ to keep in good shape.Well, as I stated in another topic:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------I've owned BMWs since 1983- 8 in all, and I perform a lot of the minor service and repairs myself. My wife drives a 2004 X3 while I currently run a 1995 318ti Club Sport; I'm the original owner. At 12 years, and 112,000 miles my ti has needed the following non-scheduled maintenance: O2 sensor(recall, replaced at a scheduled service) both fuel sending units(warranty, replaced at a scheduled service) alarm module(warranty, replaced at a scheduled service) 1 set of front brake pads(due to track use) 1 set pad/rotors front and rear 2 serpentine belts(replaced as a precaution) 2 idler pulleys 1 timing chain tensioner(replaced as a precaution) 3 sets of W or Z rated tires 1 battery(replaced at ten years, one month as a precaution) 1 brake light switch 1 thermostat 4 sets of wiper blades 5 exterior bulbs The car has seen more than a few drivers schools and autocrosses and is driven in every kind of weather except ice and snow. It's a rare drive when I don't wind it to the redline at least three or more times. No other car I've owned comes close to the reliability of my Club Sport. As a matter of fact, my son and I drove it to the movie theater just last night. The paint still shines like new, the interior has no rips, cracks, or tears, and the overall structure of the car is still extremely solid- there are no squeaks or rattles whatsoever. Over the life of the car the monthly service/repair costs have averaged @$45 per month, including the 3 sets of tires mentioned above. This year my 3er cost $57 per month to run because it required an Inspection II(major) service, a coolant flush, a front end alignment and a thermostat. If you decide to buy a Bimmer I would strongly suggest that you join the BMW Car Club of America. You get a great monthly magazine as well as access to lots of information that will allow you to make informed decisions regarding maintenance and repairs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------I'll also note that I just had my local BMW dealer change the ATF and transfer case fluid on my wife's X3. The total cost was $207.just priced out a 128i the way I want it, and it just crosses the $30K barrier. Can you say ""European Delivery""? I knew that you could.Go for it! And don't forget, once you have been a BMW CCA member for over one year, you'll get a $500-$1000 loyalty rebate when you buy most new and CPO BMWs.I "

Also wandered down and looked at a Scion TC, that's kind of a cool car, loved the glass roof.Wednesday the temp dropped to -38, the Pilot wasn't amused but did ok. This morning it was -52, the Pilot really didn't see the reason I wanted it to start at 7:30 in the morning. Overall its doing fine, but really does need a winter front to help it keep the heat in the engine.

At -52 tires are square, takes a mile or so of careful acceleration to round them out again. Try looking up Nokian tires. Those scandinavian guys know a thing or two about severe cold. They have metal studded tires as well.. Here's an article if you know how to read norwegianhttp://extra.expressen.se/pdf/dacktest.pdfGislaved is probably owned by continental. Nokian hakkapelittas, RSI are considered top notch. Even their WR allweather tires are good. Forget the bridgestone blizzaks and Michelin X-Ice. You definetely need something finnish "
"akangl","December 2007"," We actually have an amsoil dealership, just haven't switched the Pilot over yet........will do it eventually, lol.As for winter tires I've run about everything and the Blizzaks are the best I've found. All tires square up at -52, can't say as I blame them either. On our 2 trucks we have Cooper Discoverer M&S studded snow tires, works great for what the trucks do.

"qbrozen","December 2007"," But a 6 year loan on a used car ? You will be so buried you'll need a back hoe to get out.Yes ... well ... sort of ... I mean, I think one would be LESS buried than a 6-year loan on a new car since the depreciation will be slower, no? PLUS, we actually just need lower payments at the moment. In 9 months, when my wife's lease is up, we can pretty much double our payments to an existing car loan (because the plan is to pay cash for the wife's next car .. probably a used volvo wagon). And, really, how can I argue with 4.9% APR? I still don't know the numbers as far as my lease goes because I am awaiting feedback on the RWTIV board. My rough guess right now is about $4500.I talked to the wife and she is all for this transaction. She feels that the problems the Accord has been giving me will only get worse. I had to spend 5.5 hours in the car on Friday and it was torture. I think that is where the mags really fail when it comes to the Accord. They think its great, but that's because they only spend a couple of days with it. I think its around the 6-month mark where it completely loses its luster.We also rationalized that if I were to pay another year on the lease and then get an '05 bimmer at that time on a similar 6-year note, it will make almost no difference in total out-of-pocket ($385/mo for 7 years or $450/mo for 6 years). The math is really a strawman argument, but I haven't told her that yet. In any case, I think I'm talking myself out of it. I hate to spend the money right now. And, like I said, that math argument is really flawed for obvious reasons. "

Cars are expensive. Period. I mean, even a loaded Civic will run ya $400 for 5 years. I did this similar thing back when I traded a leased 626 for an off-lease volvo S70 T5.

"guss","December 2007"," the theory on leases is so that you can buy more car than you can afford normally. If I were ever to lease(not likely), I think I would be more inclined to go the other way.

(I'm getting lost).I guess I'm thinking: $400/mo. would pay for ""some"" chunk of a House Payment. Even in the Northeast, or other expensive areas, that would go for......well a not-insubstantial portion (15-30%?) of payments on a decent-if-modest property in not-the-most-expensive-town.I also think guss's idea of leasing a ride for around $200/mo. makes sense.....even if for a Focus.(I'm in my house-buying-obsessed, cheapskate mode today)..... "
"qbrozen","December 2007"," the theory on leases is so that you can buy more car than you can afford normally.well, I can't discuss the theory because I didn't invent leasing. But, I can say there is much more to it than that. Both of my current leases carry incredibly low rates. Nothing that any financing could touch (well, ok, except for a big money loser 0%). I could easily afford to buy a car much more expensive than I have, but I just couldn't stomach it. Plus, in the case of both my leases, they will be worth less than the buyout at the end of the term. So, not only did I get a ridiculously low rate and pay well below invoice for my vehicles, but I don't even have to pay their full real-world depreciation. To me, the right lease is a financial winner.The problem comes if you wind up not liking the car after a while and want to trade early. But only because alot of the financing is built in up front. You'd still lose your shirt trading a financed car early.ANYWAY, my wife said ""let's go anyway."" So we went. For those curious about the current BMW deal, it is 2.9% for 60 months. That's it. No 72-mo term and no lower rate on a shorter term.I did test drive an '04 330Ci automatic coupe with premium, sport, and cold weather. It is a very nice and fun car. A bit tighter on the headroom than I would care for, but livable. Its still amazing to me that bimmers have much more power than the numbers on paper would indicate. I took it on a couple of windy roads and some 90 degree turns and I love the balance and feel. In any case, the numbers, of course, were not favorable. But it gives me hope for the future. I'll ride out my lease and next winter I could be in a bimmer. And, as I said to my wife, a new 128 should feel very similar to the 330.  "

The only issue I will report is that Volvo seems to go through lamp bulbs very fast. The mechanic said its because of the day time running lamps. Otherwise, its a comfortable ride, and as you can tell by the miles I put on it, I do a lot of highway driving. The seats are very comfortable, the gas mileage is acceptable (premium required). The distance between oil changes is nice too at just over 7k miles for me using regular oil (not synthetic).

So I widened the net a little and found a decent 1998 Ford Mondeo 2.5 Ghia X Estate (Contour in North America). I paid ?1150 for it, asking price was ?1299, a private sale. It is fully loaded and came with a full Ford service history. So far the only problems I have found are that one of the keys is seriously worn and needs to be replaced and one of the rear doors does not lock and unlock electrically.It's been a long time since I have owned a car this old, but so far I'm very happy with it.

Take him along when you get a mechanic's evaluation of the old camry or whatever. 2. Safety first. Personally, I'd pay a few thousand more for a used volvo over a used toyota, if I could afford it.....(heck, there are rich as*hole college kids in boston driving brand new M3's). Just saying, if it was my kid, I'd feel better with him/her in an old volvo....... just my 2 cents, good luck "

I don't really want to go back into the 240 days, so an S70 will be on the list.I am not worried about a Camry or Accord. The 94 is a bit older than I wanted. Something in the '98 range (AccordAltima/Camry) will be in play. I probably won't go for something real old, or real small.A friend has a late '90s Camry that he will be upgrading to a Sienna in the next few months, so that could be an option too. "

"mark156","February 2008"," I have a story, but I'm not involved!My best friend who lives in Georga has a friend in the car business in Illinois. A fella walks into his dealership who had just bought a new 2008 Toyota Tundra truck at another dealership. He took delivery and decided after taking it home that it rode rougher than he wanted. So, he drove it back to the Toyota dealer to return it. They didn't take it back and offered him $10,000 less that he paid just hours before.He drove it to the new dealership where my best friend friend works (I've met the guy) and the Toyota guy drove a new Infiniti Q56 and traded the Tundra in. The Tundra had only 21 miles on it.Just for the record, I trust both of these guys with accurate information as it was told to me.My BIG question was, did the Toyota guy even test drive the Tundra? It's a truck!!!... how soft did he want it to ride? Anyway, what a hit in the wallet! :surprise: Mark156 "
"stickguy","February 2008"," Yeah, I know when something good drops in your lap, to pull out the old checkbook.In this case, it was in front of a house, and I went by it pretty late at night. It was gone the next day (and I am pretty sure it didn't ""live"" there) and I never saw it again. "
"nippononly","February 2008"," That qualifies for the fewest miles I have ever heard of a vehicle having at trade-in! Did the Infiniti dealer also offer him $10K below his purchase price?

"tifighter","February 2008"," Beauty, you went a little over the line though. Yeah, that's been happening a lot. It's wider than a Forester, this I can tell you... The sales guy said it just came off the truck that day. I didn't believe him but was surprised to see it had 3 miles on it when I test drove it. They hadn't done the PDI yet. Sure enough, the plate on the door jam showed the build date as Feb 2008. Color is Nimbus Grey. Looks identical to my Subie's color. I picked up my girlfriend from work after I drove it off the lot; she was standing on the sidewalk when I pulled up. Rolled down the window and told her I got myself a birthday present. She walks up to the window and asked if I got new skis. Wasn't until she sat in the car and closed the door that the something seemed different to her. She's not really a car person. It drives beautifully; so much quieter and smoother than the Subie. Jury is still out on mileage, but I am realistic about it, and don't drive a ton of miles. My first lease...so I will have to put my CCBA card in storage for a bit. I just liked the idea of sub invoice pricing and the equivalent 0.72% interest Honda has going on leases right now. If I don't like it, or if gas is $5 per gallon in 3 years, I can walk away. If I want to keep it, I can buy it for $16K. Around here, there is no such thing as a 3 year old low mileage Pilot for $16K. Seems win/win.  "

"tifighter","February 2008"," Well, my past 2 cars were a Z3 and a Forester. Of course, the Pilot is a different proposition, but it actually handles surprisingly well. Steering is a bit light but accurate; that lightness is nice for parking etc though. Since I am not programmed to not having the Subie yet, I have been throwing it in corners at similar rates of speed that I did in the Forester, and it takes it fine while not feeling at all tippy. I always thought the Forester was a good compromise of handling for what it was, so to find the Pilot in the hunt is pretty impressive to me. Also, I have not yet felt the VSA kick in during cornering. Of course, I have not driven a current generation 4 runner, but I would be shocked if it handled better than the Pilot. In other news, I installed Thule bars on the factory rails and found that it now whistles a bit over 50mph.  May need to try one of those fairings up there. "

"qbrozen","February 2008"," 1. I haven't driven a current 4-runner or CRV. It will not handle anything like any 5-series, no matter how you slice it. It is still a 4500 lb SUV. Having said that, however, it does not feel like all of its 4500 lbs would indicate. It really feels much smaller and lighter. It can be quite deceiving sometimes. I often caught myself entering turns too fast because I thought I was still in my sedan. It never became too upset at this, though, and handled those turns nicely. I can say it drives and handles much nicer than the previous gen CRV, IMHO.2. Stock tires are fine on the AWD model. Ours handled as much as 10 inches of snow and felt more stable and capable than the Forester we traded for it. "
"stickguy","February 2008"," IIRC, the Pilot drive a little more ""trucky"" than a CRV. Nice enough, but you will never mistake it for your 525.And for where you live, the tires that come on it will be fine. They are some varient of a M&S SUV tire anyway (not that I can remember what which exact tires they are). Not sure if the FWD has different sneaks than the AWD.My BIL used to have an MDX on the stock tires, in upstate NY, and that thing went through deep snow like it had a plow on it. "
"tifighter","February 2008"," What is the lease payment on one of these? And, is the VP something inbetween an LX and EX, or is it a strippo model?The advertised lease is $259/mo with $1999 down. Of course, this does not include tax, etc. so it does not really exist. With the MF so low, rolling the up most of the down costs into the lease makes a lot of sense, so figure $320-330/mo or so with only the first payment down, depending on your local tax rate. Here in Seattle, its 9.2% :sick: VP replaces the LX for 08.

"woodyww","March 2008"," I put in an internet request thru edmunds (to 4 dealers) for a quote on a new pilot EX-L. Lowest quote was around $27K. Of course I got bombarded with frantic emails & phone calls from 4 dealers for at least a week, which is predictable.Also predictably, I decided that since there's nothing wrong with my bmw (knock wood!), & so many things wrong with my house & garage, I should keep house hunting instead of car shopping (duh).Selling a near mint condition 8 y.o. bmw wagon with super-low miles seems almost wrong somehow.......of course I may change my mind tomorrow..... "
"tifighter","March 2008"," 27K seems pretty good for an EX-L if we are talking about a 4WD. Still, 5-wagon is a nice car and if it hasn't given any trouble...Speaking of Pilots, today I installed an ipod adapter for the factory stereo in mine, It charges it, and allows some control from the steering wheel. and does not interfere with the in dash changer, satellite radio, etc. Cool stuff. However, it is always a bit unnerving to pull the interior trim off of a new car though :surprise: "
"mark156","March 2008"," I was buzzing along in the CR-V on a Southern California freeway at 75 mph and saw a vehicle that I had not seen before. As I drove closer to it, I could see the Honda symbol on the back. It was a 2009 Honda Pilot. Very nice redesign. The rear end looks similar to the Scion XB but grown up. The front is more aggressive looking than the previous Pilot and I think it will be a very good seller.Mark156 "
"nippononly","March 2008"," by touring local dealers looking to see what they have in the great deals department. Found a Honda dealer with two leftover Accord EXs including one with a stick, yay! Advertised with mirror hangtags at a price that is about $3500 off sticker, so about $19,5 for the stick. Nice car. They also have leftover '07 Civics advertised at $2000 off sticker, including the hard-to-find 4-door EX with a stick. Tempting. They also have an '05 Civic HX manual, a hard car to find used, in really nice condition with 53K miles, that has me tempted to trade the Echo (gasp!). But they have it advertised at $13,995 (certified) - I assume they would take $12K with a bit of finagling, but it still seems very high for a car that sold new for like $16K (maybe $17K?) 53K miles ago. Even if it IS a Honda. Still, I may be making another visit out there. If I do, it's likely I would come home with something new, a fact I am keeping very closely in mind! "

And the mileage isn't as good as my Echo. As for the Accord, well I have a soft spot for the old Accord, and that EX stick is a nice car, which is a great deal at $19,5. The one they have left is silver though, not my fave. But mainly, I think if I am going to get an Accord, I am going to wait until the deals start on the amazing-looking coupe version of the new Accord. I am thinking EX stick 4-cylinder, maybe in a year or two. I really like the look of the new one. Much much MUCH better than the old coupe.

"corvette","March 2008"," I was really impressed with the Astra. A well-equipped small car, nice styling, good value. Not sure what's with the lack of a memory seat in the 3-door--Dad's Beetle had this. That said, the manual memory seat in the new Golf/GTI they had on display didn't seem to work right, either. I was really shocked by the momentary-contact turn signals and wipers in the Astra. Just like the current-model BMWs have. I don't care one way or another, but I do think they will generate a lot of complaints (at least the wipers will, most people don't use their turn signals and won't notice that part). "

And unlike you, of the 3 people in MY sample space of friends with VWs, only one had relatively few problems. The other two had nightmare cars, always in the shop. It makes me very cautious.

"akangl","March 2008","  the ""other"" VW forums always had several active threads going on reliability issues and other problems. After owning 2 VWs I don't think I'd travel down that road again.

Sold it 3 months later with 45k on it.Second one was an 01 Jetta 1.8T purchased new in 2001. I loved that car so much, it did great for a long time and then out of the blue the battery kept dying. Finally I got so mad at the dealer I had the darn car towed in. Got it back 3-4 days later with a lovely ring in the paint where a coffee cup had been set down and a DENT in the quarter panel that strangely resembled a BOOT! Never could prove it, they blamed the tow truck driver (yeah right, I've known him for 15 years) and he laughed and blamed them.I think I got about 10 miles with the car that day and it died. They had to tow it back again and replace some computer or something. I got rid of the car shortly after that, put a total of 20k miles on it.Now the only VW dealer is 300 miles away, always seeing a parade of VWs on tow trucks headed for anchorage. VW pays for the tow down, but people are on their own to get the plane ticket to go get their car that's now 300+ miles away! "
